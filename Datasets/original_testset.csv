" Now You See Me 2 is full of entertaining, action-packed nonsense, but this prestidigitation is less presto! than largo. In the end, these card sharks lack teeth.",0
 Miike surprises for all the wrong reasons.,0
" Hats, caps and wigs off. There's reason to dance on the streets. Here's a masterwork of technical bravura, adorned with inspired ensemble performances and directed with astonishing empathy.",1
" It never leans on the concept of singing animals too much, allowing for some character-driven scenes that make us actually care about these animals, why they are in the contest, and most importantly, their aspirations and dreams",1
" Gringo is a messy, confused entry in the crime genre that wastes its stellar ensemble on an uninspired narrative and leaves minimal impact.",0
 An uneven yarn of pregnant pauses punctuated by charm.,1
 The price of good intentions is that it looks and feels like an extended public-service announcement for goodness.,0
" Exquisitely made...offers a distinctive, compelling take on the 'Scarface' formula.",1
 A direct-to-video quality production being sent to the theaters instead in the hope of getting families to spend ten times as much money (or more) ...,0
" It's possible this movie might work better streamed on your own laptop, as the windows-within-windows effect gets multiplied. ",0
" Believe it or not, toward the end of the film, Leo gets down on his knees, looks up at the heavens and a craning camera and shouts ""Nooooooooooo!"" Just like Principal Skinner.",0
" The script, by David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg, is breathtakingly bad.",0
" It's long at 145 minutes, but it needed space to accommodate its titillating mix of police procedural, whodunnit, social satire and psychological drama.",1
" Aside from the clever engineering of the traps (and perhaps one two-timing trollop that had it coming), the story is formulaic at best.",0
 An object lesson in how to make a good documentary,1
" It just doesn't flow, giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors. ",0
 Such a fascinating moment in Dutch history is deserving of a far better vehicle than an episode of Hollyoaks produced by Harvey Weinstein.,0
" Not only is the trailer for 1408 oodles more terrifying than the movie itself; worse, for the most part, this pop-horror trifle adapted from a Stephen King short story grows into a formulaic bore.",0
" A certain smugness creeps into the corners of The Kids Are All Right. Morality doesn't have to mean Puritanism, but there is something of that here. ",0
" Part of the problem does lie in DeVine himself, who is relied on too heavily by the script and is present in essentially every scene. ",0
 The explanation is so darkly compelling-and ultimately so chilling-that The Vanishing has earned its reputation as one of the scariest non-horror movies ever made. ,1
" Leaving aside two brilliant 1963 film adaptations of [Pinter's] best work, The Caretaker and The Servant, the terse opacity of the dialogue that served his early plays so astringently has never translated well onto the big screen.",0
" There's no denying the power of that cast and the particular vision of McQueen, who turns Widows into something truly distinctive... if not necessarily effective.",1
 Manchester by the Sea defies Hollywood notion that all misfortune has an ulterior purpose or motive and that every dramatic arc must culminate in a positive change. [Full review in Spanish],1
" Resides amid half-remembered fragments of Cinemax soft-core, Turkish remakes of The Exorcist, and third-string Troma releases such as Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid.",0
" I do not believe, as far as I can remember %u2013 and I pray I don't offend, my dear reader %u2013 the line of dialogue, ""The thought of your sperm inside me is unbearable,"" derived from the pen of Conrad, but rather its harsh tones sound pure Huppertian.",0
" It takes a lot of movie magic to reduce some 3000 years of mythology to piffle. After watching this farrago produced by state-of-the-art 3-D and CGI, I'm all for the return of the oral tradition.",0
" Apted creates a graceful back-and-forth from the earlier films to the present, and the experience of seeing people who have lived so much on screen is quite profound.",1

" Sniff all you like, but Spike Island smells of nothing.",0
" I'm a huge Tina Fey fan, but Amy Poehler is sadly miscast.",0

 I honestly cannot think of anything worse that has been made in between the time the Lumiere Brothers photographed a train pulling into a station in 1895 and today.,0

" If the scenes between the four leads had been stronger, it might have been easier to overlook the film's structural and tonal weaknesses, but as it happens they only rescue it in dribs and drabs.",0
 This dark comedy does provide a breath of fresh air in contrast to all the stale and cloyingly cutesy comedies Hollywood produces.,1
" The movie chases its own tail, making fun of itself making fun of itself. By the end, whatever targets it had in its sights are so far off you can barely see them anymore.",0
 It's like a protracted teen drama with a low-budget supernatural showdown tacked on the end.,0

" My Life should be a more rigorous and single-minded film; maybe it started that way, before getting spoonfuls of honey to make the medicine go down. ",0
" Basic Instinct was a seminal 1990s film, but like a lot of things from the 1990s, it hasn't aged very well.",0
" A film with a marmite subject matter that will divide critics & audiences alike, Seeds is still worth the investment. Just get ready to feel really uncomfortable.",1
 A very appealing film.,1
" It's the Rogen-Goldberg touch, with the duo's characteristic Superbad mash of the sweet and the bracingly coarse, that sells this unusual downer/upper of a life-and-death comedy.",1
 The Aftermath arrives as a mildly engaging trifle that might have worked better as a miniseries.,0
" Like the ideal version of their mother these sisters carry in their heads, there's a better version of Mouthpiece that was never uncovered.",0
 Are there any video games where the whole point is to sit around doing nothing for 95 minutes?,0
" A neon-colored, sun-baked fantasia that's part Western spoof and part surrealist jag through the desert with Johnny Depp as our theatrically unhinged, reptilian tour guide, Rango is anything but your standard kiddie animated flick.",1
 The film's out-of-nowhere shock value conclusion suggests that Perry and Altman were really at a loss as to how to tie everything up.,0

 Casts light on what it is about the way we are that make wickedness so damnably attractive.,1
" ""The Lazarus Effect"" boasts nothing special. It's not going to provide much relief for horror-starved audiences.",0
 It's all very contrived and terminally nice. Probably too nice for its own good.,1
 All that's happened is that a dumb comedy has gotten slightly dumber.,0
" Franchise Fred would approve a golem franchise. Continue the story of Hanna's village, or visit the golem upon different periods in history, or even modern day. If this is just the origin story, Franchise Fred approves.",1
 Slickly made and worth the watch.,1
" The entire film possesses a certain longing, the sort that manifests itself and begins to grow at the moment of High School graduation, when some of the most formative circumstances of youth are remembered only as ephemeral moments.",1
" A cheerful Frankenstein's monster, cobbled together from bits of dozens of zombie gut-crunchers, plus aliens, acid rain and assorted X-Files weirdness.",0

" A total triumph, and thank goodness for that. Imagine if it had been terrible and someone else had to make a film about the making of the worst film ever made about the making of the worst film ever made. We'd be here for decades, getting ever more meta.",1
" Haggis has an extraordinary knack for choosing themes which are controversial and relevant, and then getting his actors to maximize their skills. This may yet be the best film of the year.",1
" The ""feel-bad, feel-good"" movie of the year, a well-made film that is so dark that it can be hard to watch but that is designed to illustrate the fact that the human power to overcome adversity is stronger than the instinct to shrivel and die.",1
" This live-action adaptation of an animated children's fantasy series is a leaden, joyless ride that represents another major misfire from the once-promising filmmaker.",0
 Promise me you won't go there.,0
" Seabiscuit is a godsend, an oasis in a summer of mindless spectacle. Here is a human story, an inspirational tale about real people -- and one special horse -- who conquer adversity without so much as a light saber.",1
" In particular, a collapsing car rescue shows creative build, and the fact that a tsunami is not the biggest obstacle in a tsunami sequence shows screenwriter Carlton Cuse worked overtime to provide some clever disasters.",1

" One of a kind, totally clever gangster parody with music and kids.",1
" Mad Max: Fury Road wasn't the biggest hit film of the summer of 2015 (that honor belongs to Jurassic World) but it is easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of year. Decades in the making, there's nothing else like this out there.",1
" One of the best films of the decade, Yi Yi, Edward Yang's most accessible (and very last) film is a fluent, charming and precise family portrait that celebrates ordinary life with all its joys and chaos.",1
" Every time Peter has to choose whether to do his self-appointed job or seize one irreplaceable personal moment with Liz, the strain shows on his face. Civil War made his conflicts big, funny, and thrilling. Homecoming makes them personal.",1
" The stories are pretty fascinating, but like all documentarians, Salerno faces the problem of what to put onscreen.",0
" It rekindles the warmth of great Hollywood romances, where foreplay was the climax and a kiss was never just a kiss.",1
" Doctor Strange is all about the razzle-dazzle, where spectacle elements are good enough to save a more clunky, weightless Marvel origin story.",1
" Didn't inform, reform or transform me. It was just a lot of explosions and noise signifying nothing. But for those who like that sort of thing it was perfect.",0
" If it is narrow in its appeal, then the movie is earnest about entertaining a certain strata of kid-dom who will appreciate it more than I.",1
 Nothing about it feels organic and fruitful; The Grinch feels like it is reaching an end-year quota. ,0
 Another video game transferred to the big screen with only so so results,0
" A smarter film could get away with such self-aware, self-deprecating commentary on artistic authenticity and the respective powers literature and cinema; unfortunately, The Plagiarists is no such creation.",0
" In the end, In Bruges is a bit arch and artificial, but it is more than redeemed by Farrell and Gleeson's presence, and by the bushwhacking wit of the film's writer/director.",1
" Interesting, edgy indie drama tackles racism, fitting in. ",1
" Make no mistake about it, Panic has some merits. It's unlike anything currently being done in the animation realm. Unfortunately, it lacks the playfulness and endearing qualities of its clay-animated kin...",0
" Watch it for the visuals, and dream about what Shane Acker might accomplish with a better screenplay.",1
 The result is a remake with no guiding principle beyond mere existence.,0
 Its rote characters invite none of our empathy or concern in a plot unencumbered by depth or surprises.,0
" Richard Gere, Rebecca Hall, Steve Coogan and Laura Linney collectively fail to rescue this trying-too-hard drama.",0
" An inspiring profile of the Catholic Pope who truly walks his talk about love, mercy, and service.",1
" Alas, Due Date takes a simple premise and goes nowhere with it as the two lead characters travel thousands of miles on a journey of self-discovery.",0

" The film works better when crafting its own experiments in social embarrassment, such as the scene where Milgram argues about his work with an Abe Lincoln impersonator, as opposed to the stuffy book report that dominates the final hour.",0
" Good Time isn't helped by the script,",0
" The camera-eye view is treated more as an obstacle to be overcome than a tool for storytelling, raising the question of why not just scrap it altogether.",0
" [F]antastic, a whiz-bang follow-up that far surpasses the original as it breathlessly zigs and zags all over the globe.",1
" ... doesn't offer much insight beneath the surface, especially when considered in a contemporary context.",0
" You don't get Blanchett, but you do get Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie interpreting historical drama as empty pageantry instead.",0
" The film is not, by any fair measure, a battle hymn or a call to arms. As with The Hurt Locker the film's intent is to engender respect for those doing the fighting, not to justify the reasons for the fighting. American Sniper is pro-warrior, not pro-war.",1
" Sensitive and sympathetic character study, offering gentle insight into a self-segregated community.",1
" This is a terrific performance by Gyllenhaal, completely inhabiting a spook of a man, a ghoul to remember.",1
" We'll have to wait and see if it turns into a classic, or if it will forever be overshadowed by the original movie. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" My Cousin Rachel withholds an extremely important bit of information until the last minute. And the denouement isn't set up in a way that can be believed. It's rushed, it's abject.",0
 World War Z bucks the current trend in summer blockbusters by feeling weirdly understuffed. It's an episodic adventure without enough episodes.,0
" As Christmas miracles for horror fans go, this is one stocking stuffer certain to be enjoyed for many years to come.",1
" By trying to recapture the magic of the original, Neighbors 2 has disproved the existence of magic.",0
 What The Business of Strangers really boils down to is a couple of good performances and some really interesting dialogue.,1
" ""Happy Christmas"" leans hard on the ensemble's exploratory attempts at ad hoc dialogue, so that you find yourself providing alternative snatches of banter in your head, just to speed things up a little.",0
 The success of these cartoons comes down to a willingness to reinterpret characters with both visual and thematic adventurousness. ,1
 A film with moments as exuberant as in How To Let Go is so much finer than all the ones that make you want to reach for the nearest serrated knife and nearest soft wrist.,1
" Focusing on the quiet, assured Bernstein's unassuming but powerful presence, Hawke's film often plays like an attempt to share Bernstein's experience with the world.",1
 Nixon is splendid. Davies makes connection between the art and the life clear as light.,1
" I'm not suggesting The Angels' Share is a chock full of bellylaughs, but it's the first Loach film in some time that lacks the sensation of having a plastic grocery bag pulled over one's face.",1
" Even if the visually similar Cloverfield and the thematically similar District 9 didn't already exist, this would still seem painfully hackneyed and obvious.",0
 If only I could go back in time to convince myself not to watch this ludicrous time travel yarn which 'faxes' a group of uninteresting characters back to the 1300s to screw up the space-time continuum.,0
 Murugadoss gets the 'hero moments' right.,1
" Attention to behavioral detail is extraordinary, led by a thunderous performance from Florence Pugh, who makes a mighty leap to industry visibility with her brave, dark, and thrillingly commanding work.",1

 The Water Horse features an awkward combination of real-life drama and cutesy physical humor that never blends.,0
" Frankly, Bloodlight and Bami is an unstructured mess, but it does a fair job of contextualizing [Grace] Jones' art through her Jamaican roots.",1
 The film's pleasures are greatly outnumbered by its failed expectations.,0
" If the best crime documentary is meant to be more provocative than polemical, if it is to be a film that articulates rather than advocates, than Berlinger's Whitey just may be one of the best.",1
" Like an ecological Lust, Caution, this contempo fairy tale about a mermaid who falls for the evil developer she's been sent to seduce and assassinate is strikingly relevant to China",1
" In the midst of this already overheated summer movie season, it feels like a cool drink of water.",1
 Justin Timberlake as the voice of the wiumpy Artie is certainly the best new addition to the Far Far Away Kingdom,1
" There are some interesting ideas and themes in The Rite; unfortunately, an uneven tone and a disappointingly generic climax dilute them.",0
" Kong: Skull Island is pretty good popcorn cinema, but it's more of a business plan - than a movie - which involves a lot of movies of which this is only one. As for what it's about - the big pissed off monkey - is what it's about. ",1
" Patrick McGrath's novel provides a solid and suspenseful story, even if it loses much of its bite in Mackenzie's hands.",1
" A smashing, funny and politically sophisticated feature debut from Julie (daughter of Costa) Gavras.",1
" Chastain puts on the persona like it's a superhero costume. It is an awkward fit. Madden's stagy direction doesn't help ... nor does first-time writer Jonathan Perera's pseudo-Sorkinesque, exposition-laden, quippy dialogue.",0
" The tour stops may have been successful, as Vaughn claims, but the documentary of it comes off more as a well-intentioned vanity production than the career launching pad he envisioned.",0
 Excels at showing us characters and situations that turn out to be far more complicated than they initially appear.,1
" The film is so choppy, especially in the final going, it appears that entire reels have been cut.",0
" Just once, it would be refreshing to see Britain look like something other than a country-living catalogue.",0
" If nothing else, it'll make you think twice about dropping a Cornetto wrapper on any English heritage site - or not without checking over your shoulder first.",1
" Movies about sex should be messy and confusing, filled with human foibles, but too often they are utterly strait-laced. This one gets it right.",1
" It's unfortunate, then, that this earnest, hard-working adaptation of the 2006 Michelle Wildgen novel... isn't a more satisfying dramatic portrayal of the disease and its impact.",0
" In an outstanding, raw performance, Washington never strays from Whip's rough road of addiction and psychological turmoil.",1
" As a spoof of the 1970s Bollywood, Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om is well-conceived and executed. As a story about reincarnation, it disappoints.",0
 It's not even that the film is an unwatchable disaster -- it's just a big disappointment.,0
 We've been left with a film that can't settle on which history it wants to tell and ends up dispelling the myth that a new film by Michael Mann is a cause worth celebrating.,0
" Only a wake-up call if you were never a teenager, never met a teenager, and perhaps have never heard of teenagers, no matter how old you are.",0
" This tedious sequel is more of the same, for better and worse - except that it lacks the freshness of the original and feels more transparent in its effort to appeal strictly to basic instincts.",0
" a crackerjack Bond film that cannily mixes the harder, more severe edges of the previous Craig films with a sly sense of humor",1
" The dialogue rattles along at a tremendous pace, with the gags feeling organic and largely sophisticated.",1
" So finely and honestly observed for much of its running time, the confidence doesn't seem to quite be there to let the film's most dramatic moments work on their own power without musical or editorial augmentation. ",1
 Schwartzman and Law are pitch-perfect in their roles as dueling poster boys for a transcendent existence versus a materially rich life.,1
 Stories told again and again have a way of neatening things up. Stories have a way of ironing out the wrinkles. Polley lets the wrinkles remain.,1
 Call it an art-house slasher film. Call it a beautiful mess. Just don't call me with questions about what any of it means.,0
" Emerges as a weighty, fitting salute to Wilson's restless creativity and a touching celebration of the love that would prove to be his salvation.",1
 A comedy with two left feet.,0
" Zwick may as well have titled his newest action-adventure The Constant Gardener II: Diamonds Are Forever, as it peddles the same distasteful, condescending attitudes toward Africa as did Fernando Meirelles' 2005 fiasco.",0
" This is agreeably exciting and tense at times, despite the fact that it's obvious that very little of it is, you know, real.",1
 Entertaining and amusing and charming in its refusal to dismiss the cathartic nature of retributive violence.,1
" Unfortunately, the first casualty is good acting, which dies a noisy, overly dramatic death.",0
" Actor Clea DuVall shows a sly sense of humor in her directing debut, The Intervention, a pleasantly funny and awkward comedy.",1
" Even though Burn After Reading is often funny, it rarely achieves either the hilarity of Intolerable Cruelty or the iconic goofiness of The Big Lebowski.",1
" As gentle, reliable, and pretty to look at as the falling of the leaves. It also has approximately the same level of dramatic tension.",1
" The fact that commentators, pundits, and politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are condemning Zero Dark Thirty is a sure sign that director Kathryn Bigelow and journalist-turned-screenwriter Mark Boal have done something right.",1
 I ended up really enjoying it...and looking forward to the sequel we are clearly being prepared for. Sherwood Forest and all.,1
" In this case, Solondz's mixture of cynicism and smugness doesn't go deep enough or seem truthful enough to matter much.",0
" The film falls short because it falls between two stools: as a reminder of a shameful period in our recent history it's too interested in finding cheap laughs, and as a comedy it's just too painful and ugly.",0
" It's a skillful piece of filmmaking and an impressive debut, though it's so relentlessly bleak and downbeat for most of its running time that it can't recover when it tries to go soft in its third act.",0
" Moving, mesmerising and genuinely from the heart, the extraordinary new Australian documentary holds a mirror to the unique life and music of the late indigenous singer-songwriter Gurrumul Yunupingu.",1
" More than some run-of-the-mill social-awareness doc, the film pays as much attention to the personal and emotional strife of its subjects as it does to their activism. ",1
" Trumbo may not be filling, but in certain snappy moments, it's awfully tasty. ",1
" This unabashed Harry Potter clone is enjoyable enough, thanks to Black's campy theatricality and Blanchett's sly minimalism.",1
" It's Schrader's on-point filmmaking--a nouveau spin on the spiritual films, character studies, and transcendental style of cinematic Old Masters like Bergman and Bresson--that functions as what Toller calls 'another form of prayer.'",1
" The anvil-like weight of contrivance nearly sours the quality of the whole film, but there's still some story worth savoring, even if Lurie makes the audience work hard to extract it.",0
" It's the multitude of miniature narratives that gives Pedro Costa's film its abiding, silent outrage.",1
 Ennui and eroticism make an oddly alluring combo in Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte.,1
 This one's a retake on 'Twilight.' I'd hang out in a different hood if I had the chance.,0
" While not lacking for lamentations from women or anybody else, primarily concentrates on the ""crush your enemies"" part. The movie fails because it can't make that gore interesting",0
" This is quite possibly one of the most boring movies that I've ever had to sit through, especially in the realm of animation.",0
 This profile offers a rich kaleidoscope of people and situations...,1
" It's easy enough to explain what Hold the Dark is about ... As for what the movie is About, that's much more difficult to deduce.",0
 What would make South of the Border a better movie is an Oliverstonectomy.,1
 it's characteristic of the restless verve and spirit of Mizrahi's filmmaking that she doesn't let his piece settle into fatalism or sentimentality.,1
" There are few things more cinematically painful than watching a cast work really hard to make you laugh and fail with consistency. That's the experience that Killing Gunther offers, and it is a rough watch.",0
" Violence can be used for various purposes, good, ill, and incoherent. This would be the primary observation made by V for Vendetta.",0
 the film ends with a muddle; several stories have been shown onscreen but none of them have really said anything.,0
 Awesome filmmaking.,1
 This suspense-challenged spy opera nonetheless can serve today's CIA recruitment program with its look-see into the training program at 'The Farm.',1
" I doubt that any other film released in 2019 will be as breathtaking as Apollo 11, a glorious IMAX documentary that simply flings you into the excitement of what Walter Cronkite is heard calling ""man's greatest adventure.""",1
" Tomorrowland is meant to be uplifting, and I came out of it thoroughly depressed.",0
" The victim swears the director is one Kevin Smith. Yet the high level of non-funniness here, registering 7.6 on a yawn-alyzer, suggests Mr. Smith is being impersonated by a talentless gun-for-hire trying to pass for someone who can make people",0
" Amid all of its hollow patriotism and gaps in logic, perhaps the biggest flaw with the film is its sheer predictability.",0
" Relying in no small part on Smith's reliably first-rate performance, Concussion is a thoughtful and interesting story neglectfully executed.",0
" The word 'unwatchable' is overused when it comes to bad movies, but this is a case when its employment does not represent hyperbole.",0
 Behind the Music this (thankfully) is not.,1
" Squanders the abilities of these usually fearless, formidable actresses with material that's entirely predictable and a high sap factor that belongs in a made-for-cable production.",0
" Garner is supposed to have a teenage mentality, but she marches around with preternaturally good posture and speaks her lines as if she's still auditioning for the part.",0
" Is this a glossy feature-length advert for toys? Nope, it's a whimsical and hilarious piece of animated nostalgia from Phil Lord and Chris Miller.",1
 Let the Right One In is certainly well-made and miles more thoughtful than you might expect a teenage vampire film to be.,1
" Though frequently festive, Punks' performances are uneven, and the predictable narrative, while avoiding melodramatic traps, slips into sappy ones.",0
" It's a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting you see on the front page of this newspaper.",1
" Sadly, Simien would rather introduce confrontational mischief than actually show his homework. ",0
" There are only so many monster-centric jokes to be made before they become toothless, and only so many ways to preach tolerance before it sounds more like blunt moralizing. ",0
" Pixar, of course, remains the gold standard for animated family films, but the Spy vs. Spy-style antics of Despicable Me and those lovable Minions probably guarantee that Despicable Me will produce some progeny.",1
 The newest thriller from the Academy Award-nominated writer does not disappoint.,1
" Rogen and Byrne, in particular, have grown into quite the complementary comedic duo in both Neighbors flicks, and it's that pairing that will earn my ten bucks once again whenever the inevitable Neighbors 3 shows up at my local multiplex.",1
" As Lion King did before it, Toy Story revived the art of American children's animation, and ushered in a set of smart movies that entertained children and their parents. It's a landmark movie, and doesn't get old with frequent repetition.",1
" Fast-paced, inventive animated comic adventure of a Stone Age family gets an extra boost from the lively vocal performances of stars Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds.",1
" ""Vacation"" attempts to recreate the charm of the classic with actors who know how to read the lines but don't embody the characters. And they're forced to speak within a lazily written story that doesn't add enough to justify coming back.",0
" Are we any the wiser at the end of this exercise in beautiful, messed-up nihilism? Not a bit. Could we stop watching? Not for a moment.",1
 U.S. soldiers try to establish a base of operations in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. Rough-hewn documentary shows front-line fighting in vivid detail.,1

" There are enough surprises to let you leave the theater mostly satisfied, if not exactly transformed.",1
 The action sequences in this movie are better than anything most movies or franchises could ever hope to get.,1
 Allied is as if a snazzy new copy machine was supposed to print out a presentation in eye-popping colors and ended up spitting it out in plain old black and white. You can read it but it's dull to look at.,0
 A mystic and mesmerizing journey of adventure and self-discovery.,1
" The sum is effectively greater than the parts, but Tarantino knocks one out of the park with a brilliant action-thriller that stands up on its own merit.",1
" Its epic imagery - the rows of soldiers, the rain of spears, the surging forces - is undercut by the Saturday-matinee cheesiness of the concept.",0
" Inglourious Basterds is not boring, but it's ridiculous and appallingly insensitive-a Louisville Slugger applied to the head of anyone who has ever taken the Nazis, the war, or the Resistance seriously.",0

" Robin Campillo's drama is sweet and neat, as ambitious as it is gripping.",1
 Barely fresh. Some fun bits. A half hour too long for what it is. Superhero fatigue setting in.,1
 Pixar produces the best movies on the planet. Period. Want proof? After Toy Story 3 the audience cried then cheered. And critics cried. Critics don't cry. Ever.,1

 Fair enough rendering of a fanciful event.,1

" Its female figures fail to represent the real state of moral and social topic, they all act in extreme black and white, no gray area. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
 ...a sporadically intriguing yet hopelessly misguided endeavor.,0
" I personally object to kitschy, green, Mickey-D type plastic toys in a Sam Peckinpah type western setting, but the bottom line is, it's quite a good small-child film.",1
" The film serves an effective marketing tool after all, with some lively footage and funny interviews. It's just too bad viewers can't see the actual play.",1
 A very moving heartfelt film.,1

 Fans and families alike should have fun.,1
" It's doubtful that it will be remembered so fondly in years to come (unless it's because of their nonsensical decision to waste Richard Jenkins), but it's fun while it lasts.",1

" As Fifties monster movies go, the 1957 production isn't bad. There are a couple of good shock cuts, a special attention paid to idiosyncratic supporting players, and the usual mix of romance, military efficiency and doomed teenagers.",1
" This is a visually appealing, thoroughly innocuous movie that you could safely take your grandmother to see. But I predict that it will have the staying power of Grease 2. ",0
" What happens next is intended to highlight a moral crisis ... but there is no nuance to its brutal execution, making it not only hard to watch but even harder to believe. ",0

" The chemistry is never there between Anderson and West, probably because the latter is stuck trying to make sense of a character written to repel sensible people and decisions. West makes a valiant effort.",0
" After weathering the movie's mood swings and enduring its overwrought ending, you'll be begging for satire on bended knees.",0
" While the thought of Carano punching and kicking her way around the Caribbean sounds irresistible, In the Blood is directed by John Stockwell, who has a habit of making potential fun feel like a prison sentence. ",0
" Unfortunately, the movie could use a bit of pachyderm memory, given its habit of flashing back to Tien's childhood with exactly the same footage used in previous flashbacks. Instead of the narrative being deepened, it keeps getting shallowed.",0
" Never rises above polished plastic, formulaic, and pedestrian.",0
" The movie is done with crispness, vigor, down-home humor, and an over-all tang of good feeling, but the pushing of buttons is the work of extraordinary calculation.",0
 Heavy on atmosphere but light on scares.,0
" The movie is uneven, largely because it's trying something unusual and ambitious. But that unusual ambition also makes it deeply moving.",1
" As bastardizations of beloved children's books go, this one isn't terrible-certainly not as offensive as The Cat in the Hat, for instance-but it has the potential to be a genuinely good movie and blows it. That's a real shame. In a total...",0

 An undercooked piece of pulp fiction that could use another pass through the oven.,0
" I don't say the film is crap because I disagree with it. I say it's crap because it disagrees with itself. It teems with contradictions, false dichotomies, and specious reasoning.",0
" An infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men.",0
" 'Boy Erased' is a horror film. Instead of people being murdered or mutilated, the soul and psyche are assaulted. Guilt and words are the armaments used to mentally maim those being treated.",1
 The film manages to achieve that unique tone of Australian self-deprecation tempered by frustration but resolutely remaining positive about the future.,1
" If Stone's portrait of George Bush is laid on with a trowel, maybe it's because God seems to have engineered the real Bush's life with a similarly crude sense of irony.",1
 An arguably brilliant film with the noncontradictory potential to bore half its intended audience and enchant the other half.,1
" Pretty sappy stuff, but the film-makers use knowing humour to snare more cynical viewers and are well-served by the cast.",1
" Dan in Real Life is a comedy of faith that, in its wised-up feel-good way, restores yours.",1
" I was turned on, and it really confused me.",1
" In this gleaming little gem of a documentary, a janitor devotes everything to the cause of bringing fresh water to his Haitian village. It's the rare example of an issue film that lets its subjects sell the story instead of having it thrust upon them.",1
 It's just another comedy of contrived mortification and misunderstanding.,0
 You do enjoy yourself but you'll enjoy yourself much more with a real Indian movie.,1

 An almost complacent action story similar to a Bourne film. [Full review in Spanish],0

" Most compelling, is how in a rare moment of collective solidarity, rapidly assembled crews spontaneously came together to save everyone. And that's quite an unusual sighting in a movie these days, with the deepening divisive climate in society right now.",1
 Better this log-headed Pinocchio had been burned at the stake.,0
" This (and the disappointingly overlooked Take This Waltz from 2012) is just the beginnings of an outstanding venture into raw, mature drama for Sarah Silverman.",1

" I liked the film, but its various standout performances and production numbers end up overshadowing the overall offering. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)",1
 More Jean-Claude Van Damme than Woody Guthrie or John Steinbeck. And not very good Van Damme at that.,0

 A knocked-down version of producer Judd Apatow's brand.,1
 A defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low-budget British cinema as it goes.,1

 A fine piece of cheap entertainment.,1
" Up may be the first Pixar film about actual people, and for all of its computer-generated visions and 3D inventions it's always about human emotion and human experience.",1
 The whole is thought-provoking and funny.,1
" A meandering and in some ways oddly memorable anthology of sweat-soaked lunacy, Pawn Shop Chronicles lurches to and fro, lacking a dynamic narrative throughline.",0

 A soulless box-ticking travelogue of young adult tropes that arrives years after the genre gravy train has dried up.,0
" Emotional engagement has never been one of Polanski's strong suits, but the film succeeds in spite of that.",1
 [It's] a rousing entertainment with eye candy in abundance. Rules Don't Apply is witty and weird by turns. ,1
" After thinking it'd take ""a couple months"" to ink, director Christopher Nolan took eight years to painstakingly write the ""Inception"" script. And you can tell. It's his first pure masterpiece.",1
 Why is the dialogue so muffled and clipped that it's hard to understand? Why didn't Mr. Jordan spend more time grounding his self-enchanted script in some semblance of reality?,0
" Such a crowded, colorful, more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason, it doesn't.",1
" The action sequences alone are jaw dropping, heart racing affairs but flashy stunts and technical wizardry don't always support a story lacking in character development, therefore giving you minimal people to root for. ",0
 A non-stop idea fest told in the form of real conversations people have.,1
 [Washington and Davis] first performed August Wilson's play on Broadway in 2010 to rave reviews and Tony awards. Their deep knowledge of their characters shows.,1

" That rarest of movies, a moribund Harrison Ford vehicle, stodgily dull, and seemingly endless in its monotony.",0
 Lady in the Water challenges us to believe in the power of myth. But the big challenge here is surviving the tedium of Shyamalan's meandering inventiveness. What's supposed to be fanciful storytelling is really just audience punishment.,0

 It has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past.,0
" There's a sincere and honest mother-son bond that exists between Griffith and Winslet. And, in fact, the trio have a nice chemistry and make for an appealing screen family. Whether you choose to believe it, though, is another matter.",1

" While Hitman is decidedly more watchable than Resident Evil and most previous video-game movies, it shares its forerunners' lack of interest in storytelling or logic.",0
 Ridley Scott's futuristic lost astronaut epic is a string of logic puzzles shot through a lighthearted ensemble dramedy that feels part 'Avengers' and part 'Gravity.',1

" Occasionally, some fool gets the idea that his literary wretched excess would make for a good film.",0
" Definitely one to catch for anyone who enjoys inventive takes on film, gorgeous looking movies and personal struggles from another era.",1
" Fortunately, Ted 2 is more hit than miss, trading strongly on the still winning camaraderie between Mark Wahlberg and his foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane) and some genuinely laugh out loud gags.",0
" It pulses with erudition and visual kicks, but has the dulled impact of a time-sensitive bottled message that has washed ashore years too late to be of any practical use.",0
" Bitingly funny, deeply strange and hauntingly melancholic.",1

" One of the most involving and well-made space-set thrillers since Ridley Scott's 1979 opus, Alien.",1
 Director and scenarist execute their tale with enough restraint - reflective of the lead character's stunted emotional range - to eke out poignancy from what's at core a somewhat predictable narrative arc.,1

" [It] works as a big screen version of one of the great achievements of the musical stage, as a dark and scary horror film, and as Tim Burton's finest film in over a decade.",1
" For lack of an actual film to remake, Hollywood's fallback position is to concoct a hybrid cannibalization of not one, but several, past successes -- in this case, Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married and It's a Wonderful Life.",0
" The film builds an exacting, creeping tension that lasts almost the duration of the running time",1
" Busily adventurous, packed with exotic creatures and boys-in-the-sandbox playfulness, and altogether kind of fake.",0
 Sharp costuming and set design can't disguise this two-hour music video from OutKast.,0
" While the film cannot quite get enough out of the men, the women tower over the production and make Mary Queen of Scots one of the most interesting features of the year",1
 Reitman does succeed at showcasing the sympathetic imagination and flesh impact of his two stars in authentic scenes of domestic mess and cleanup. And Cody attains new legitimacy and veracity as a writer. ,1

" I'll admit the film held my attention but I left the theater unsatisfied, which I think will be a common reaction among those not within the demographic niche for which the production was mounted.",0
 a light-hearted and enjoyable slacker comedy-sort of an Animal House meets Revenge of the Nerds exercise in silliness.,1
" Despite the touchy subject matter, Syeed avoids preaching and instead focuses on the protagonist's day-to-day struggle; the understated drama benefits also from Yoni Brook's crisp cinematography and Abdirahman's multifaceted performance.",1
" Emotionally deeper, better looking and twice as exciting as the blockbuster that kicked off the franchise two years ago, Spider-Man 2 just became the new gold standard for the current crop of super-hero movies.",1

" Small children might just find the film's energy enough to please, but the plot-holes stop Storks from taking flight.",0
" The movie seems fairly disgusted by Kroc's actions, but like director John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's also tonally confused -- not quite a drama, but not a satire either.",0
 A flawed but amusing dark comedy that plays like a delightfully strange mix between Doctor Dolittle and American Psycho.,1
" A lot of famous faces populate the courtroom in this overplotted and farfetched tale of jury-tampering, but they and the horse they rode in on are all so mired in illogical, head-scratching incoherence, they need lawyers of their own.",0

" One the most lovable, moving films I have seen in recent years.",1
" Despite a feeble interlinking plot and some contrived serendipity and irony, most of these tales of con men, artists, losers, and lovers come off as acting and screenwriting exercises.",0
" Flawless in the still manner it approaches crippling encounters with grief and disgust, dryly expressing the necessary unraveling of a distracted man. The Descendents is simply terrific, profound yet understated. ",1

" All he wanted, Jiro ruminates in this film, was to create something beautiful. Which is, at least, a feat that director Miyazaki has achieved. Once again.",1
 A film that very much loses its way. ,0
" The film's raison d'etre is the simple sight of large wildlife up close and personal, and it's mesmerizing.",1

 It follows the well-worn pathways of countless police dramas before it.,0
" Filmmaker Jacquot has always had a knack for directing actresses, and both Seydoux and Kruger luxuriate in the end-of-an-era-ness.",1
" I think Edward Cullen has Asperger's syndrome... Bella should totally go for Jacob instead, but then he could do way better with any of the townies... Edward looks lame ripping trees out of the ground and jumping around the forest like Tom Cruise on Oprah",0

 Nathanson's rich mix of wit and sentiment culminates in a moment so moving that it blooms within you as you watch.,1
 The film is directed with a surprising lack of comic spark by Jonathan Lynn.,0

 This may be the dorkiest movie of the year.,0
" With stock MMA fight shots taken, there are a total of three fights shown in the film. The sound is so unsynchronised, that you hear punches which Jeetu didn't even throw. The performances are more comical than serious, and not in a good way.",0

 The astonishing creation of mood and command over film style on display in Chanel Coco & Igor Stravinsky make it so much more than yet another biopic.,1
" I wouldn't call the viewing experience...enjoyable. But it's impressive, very beautiful, and, at times, undeniably exciting.",1
" Because all of this looks blatantly unreal, and because the timing of the shock effects is so haphazard, Dead Alive isn't especially scary or repulsive. Nor is it very funny.",0
 This is a dark and sometimes deeply uncomfortable drama. Yet Close makes it pretty much a must-see.,1

 Jurassic Park is the most self-reflexive blockbuster ever made ...,1
" The problem is the screenplay, which has weak, unforceful dialogue and tends to substitute dramatic events for characterization.",0
 One redeeming feature of this picture is that it will make great fodder for those make-fun-of-the-movie TV shows.,0
 ...a much more thoughtful story that expresses the deserved good feelings we have for the best of the best.,1
 This is all very dumb. That the film doesn't know it is agony.,0

" Need for Speed,"" the latest popcorn release based on a video game, is not the worst movie I've ever seen... but it's close... ",0
" It's not that writer-director David Freyne is incapable of finesse - ""The Cured"" has long and affecting passages marked more by sadness and melancholy than horror - but he seems to have misjudged the overtone here.",0

" A Wrinkle in Time is about traveling through time and space, but it is also itself an act of time travel.",1
" Diminutive and energetic, he exudes comedy with every spirited step and elaborate gesture. He's hilarious, but almost as important, he's self-aware enough to joke about his own shortcomings.",1
" Ty Burrell turns out to be the secret ingredient that makes this movie as much fun as it is, even if it borders on Peter Sellers redux, because he isn't just looking for laughs.",1
 That 50 First Dates is awful is no surprise--that it appears to have had the potential to be great is just heartbreaking.,0

" Like many a contemporary lowbrow comedy, MacGruber's at its best when it's most vulgar, when its foul-mouthed and essentially insane hero is free to indulge in his signature bits of raunchy whimsy. ",1
" At times ludicrous and exhilarating, A Cure for Wellness embraces the silliness of its plot without a hint of irony... This is Roger Corman territory, and Verbinski delights at the chance to pull the camera back and watch the world burn.",1
" The splendid photography and tempestuous John Adams score cannot quite conceal that the film is uncomfortably close to being an extravagantly elongated, Fendi-clad episode of Dynasty.",0
" An aimless charade of doggy poo, latex breasts and really, really bad language.",0

 Places too much time in the hands of disposable characters - so that it is neither a brainless slasher flick nor an immersive character piece based in a serial massacre.,0
" [Gordon-Levitt's] performance is flawless in a film that is mildly flawed, a film whose twists and turns really don't amount to more than slight bends in the road.",1
" Jurassic World, the latest incarnation of the franchise, is lacking the deft sense of wonderment, wit and suspense that guided the original.",0
 It leaves the odd impression of being merely a very long trailer for a film you'd actually love to see.,0

" Away We Go is a cute, likeable movie. For about 10 minutes.",0
" The film doesn't really do anything radical here; it sticks to the mock-doc format perfected by This is Spinal Tap, but it's funny in that cringe-inducing laugh-or-cry way that made The Office such a great show.",1
" Braff's heart is very much 'in it' as Natalie Portman's Sam would say, and while his character fantasizes about science fiction role-playing, the complete storyteller is looking for the reality in our everyday fictions and how it applies to all of us.",1

" Even if you are rooting for this film to succeed, you find yourself sitting through the tear-jerking part of the movie without feeling terribly wrapped up in it.",0
" Alicia Vikander gamely steps into the kick-ass role twice played by Angelina Jolie, but the derivative story and cardboard supporting characters are straight out of 1930s movie serials.",0
 Cheers to all for tempering bile with humor and compassion. Sappy? Maybe. Also irresistible fun.,1

" ""Kickboxer: Vengeance"" isn't going to raise anyone's SAT score, but it's passable in the realms of kickboxing cinema and will hold your attention during late-night cable viewing.",0
 Even more irritating than the film's third act triumphs is its lack of faith in moviegoers' intelligence.,0
 It's a film full of delicate metaphors and gentle humour.,1
" It's sentimental but informed by a surprisingly adult sensibility: There is no magic that can save us, there is sometimes catharsis in destruction, sometimes the guilty go unpunished.",1
 A hit-and-miss affair with some scenes and relationships ringing true and others drowning in a deep pool of artifice.,0
 Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesn't it usually take longer before everyone's eager for candy spun from trauma?,0

 The Coen Brother's most recent film is a treat filled with cinephilia; a splendidly fun homage to post-war Hollywood. [Full Review in Spanish],1

" Lee's ensemble cast does uniformly fine work, with the often underused Leguizamo as a tremendous standout.",1
" Although New Orleans sparkles as the film's setting, the story boasts too many moving and mismatched parts to resonate in any sort of meaningful way.",0
 The plot writing and the development of the two main characters in the film are weak.,0
" This subject matter can be tough to traverse, but Lewis embraces the challenge and makes us wonder why he stopped acting in the first place.",1
" ""Indivisible"" tells the compelling true story of a military chaplain and PTSD.",1
" Rodriguez plans ""Machete"" sequels. Here's hoping the next is sharper and cuts closer to the bone.",0
" The rom-com spark simply isn't there between the pair, which results in a couple of characters' large egos interplaying.",0
" What a little jewel of a film this is. Sumptuous looking... excellently acted and scripted, light on its feet but filled with a sense of purpose, and, at its core, a sharply observed character study. Hard to fault.",1
" After this, after ""Movin' Out"" (based on the deplorable songbook of one Willliam Joel), it's not even satire to suggest that the next big thing will be a musical inspired by the oeuvre of Howard Jones",0
" A kaleidoscopic, non-linear meditation with little coherence, it's bizarre, discordant and surreal - recommended only for Dylan devotees, definitely not a mainstream movie.",0
" The story is pure fiction, but told with the dignity and self-assurance of an Oliver Stone conspiracy tale.",1
" Straightforward, but its authenticity is unquestionable.",1
" The story alone is captivating, but the performances given in this film take it to another level. Michelle Williams does a great job portraying the determined mother who is ready to take on the Getty family to save her son.",1
" Mulligan is spot-on, the rest hovers between solid and forgettable.",1
 There's no reason for you to see Under the Eiffel Tower unless you enjoy being tortured for 87 minutes.,0
" Evil Dead owes everything to its predecessor, and [director Fede] Alvarez never tries to hide that fact, even when his movie feels painfully redundant.",0
" For every privileged moment (mother and daughter dancing in a yard of screen-like sheets hanging in the breeze), there's a death or sociopathic act that says movies can ruin your life.",0
" Lacking the psychological intimacy afforded by the page, Daniel Alfredson's film won't inspire better than a shrug from audiences.",0
 Resurgence inexplicably over-complicates a simple entertainment equation by stuffing too many unnecessary old and new characters (plus many inconsequential sidekicks) into all available gaps.,0
" Preserves much of the novel's intricacy and human drama, perhaps due to Salman Rushdie's involvement as co-screenwriter, even if it remains singularly unremarkable from a cinematic perspective.",0
" Directors John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who wrote the wickedly hilarious Bad Santa, assume a mocking tone that falls flat. They aspire for a cleverly offbeat vibe, but it feels forced and calculated.",0
" Ozon manages to keep the tale just this side of crazed but convincing in the film's first half. Thereafter, he relies too much on the old standby of dream sequences and the drama tips into melodrama.",0
" [Craig] Gillespie's film is a hilarious, heartrending masterpiece -- a comedy, tragedy and drama of Shakespearean proportions with teased hair and sequins.",1
" Amy Berg's deeply sympathetic documentary on Janis Joplin -- a singer whose shredded wail tapped reservoirs of pain -- gets so much right, it feels like a major act of cultural excavation. ",1
" Chamber of Secrets is not quite the magical mystery tour that the first one was. Despite some major improvements, the movie is often sluggish in pacing and intrigue.",1
" Sigismondi appears less concerned with factual accuracy and compelling storytelling, whether she's addressing the band's swaggering music or Currie's bisexual proclivities.",0
" Beneath the well-tuned atmospherics lurks a schlocky, ludicrous and distasteful yarn",0
" Stories We Tell is clearly a form of creative catharsis for Polley. Yet through its clarity and sincerity her documentary gathers greater meaning, transcending its humble origins and effortlessly enrapturing the audience with its bittersweet tale.",1
" Bombastic and noisy, yet minuscule in emotional heft, it's a geostorm in a teacup.",0
" This documentary made me laugh, made me cry, and I had to bite my tongue to keep from singing along. It's informative, entertaining, and hard not to love.",1
" Ultimately too clever for its own good, but if you can accept the film's poker-faced absurdity on its own terms, you'll appreciate Soderbergh and his cast's cool confidence.",1
" The biggest weakness of this film is that neither the horror nor the suspense appear at any time, the result is rather mediocre. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" He tends to start with a small idea, then figure out the big idea behind his observation, then figure out the shortest way to communicate the absurdity of that imbalance - the absurdity of putting so much stock into the smallest thing possible.",1
 The plot of Sparkle fails to shine.,0
 This story of real-life Austrian criminal Johann Kastenberger is both tranquil and gripping.,1
 It's Amy Adams who lends the role a heart bigger than the frame can contain. I defy anyone to watch this movie and not fall hopelessly in love with her performance.,1
" We hear Ray Charles' sentimental tribute ""Georgia"" turned into a hiccuping stuck record mixed with something harsher. This mash-up sets the stage for the conflicts the characters face between where they've been and where they want to go. ",1
" For non-discerning action fans looking to satisfy your adrenaline rush, you can add this film to your most wanted list.",1
" It is sometimes maudlin, sometimes trivial and sometimes very moving, but never less than achingly sincere.",1

 Another bizarre and beautiful excursion courtesy of one of Hollywood's most creative minds.,1
" Considering the ramifications of its true-life story, this earnest legal melodrama about fighting the system never achieves the necessary urgency or poignancy.",0
" The puerile levels to which it sinks make even Goldmember, the crudest of the Austin Powers movies, look like Brief Encounter.",0
" A white male with a midlife crisis isn't exactly new material for a movie, but White's screenplay and Stiller's performance are so alive to both the silliness and the sadness of Brad's predicament that it becomes something fresh and piercing.",1
" The American Side shows glimmers of ingenuity, both with its use of Tesla mystique and with atmospheric location work that makes Buffalo a presence.",1
" The humor, the bullies and the gawky heroes all just sit flatly on the screen rather than exploding off of it.",0
" This is a great movie, and I am not surprised to find Susan Sontag describing it as 'one of the most extraordinary, beautiful, and original works of art that I know of.'",1
 Where this picture really fails is in the fallacy that it needs to be a comedy at all.,1
" Benicio Del Toro stars in this lushly art-designed 19th-century period film, but his beefcake-gone-bad magnetism is not enough to justify sitting through a movie that's full of sound, fury and unintentional camp -- and is still bafflingly inert.",0
" Magnolia knows that life's randomness can also produce hope, humor and love. And it shows that in ways that more calculated feelgood movies can't fathom.",1
" Intelligent and insightful, The Namesake celebrates family in a unique way.",1
" The film Monstrum too is a hybrid creature, combining elements of action, adventure, horror, politics, romance and comedy in a barreling, unwieldy form that will sweep even the most fastidious of viewers along its relentless narrative trajectory...",1
" With ""No Country for Old Men,"" the brothers Coen return to Texas -- and to form.",1
" Could there be any dobut that a horror movie starring kooky, uncanny string-bean Crispin Glover would be a weird B-movie bonanza of creepy-crawly macabre?",1
 The lustre of Lowlife is that it doesn't pull its punches but finds beauty and a curious humanity in the chaos of the crime-ridden city.,1
" For all its devotion to directorial style, Europa is also impressive for the way it continually juggles narrative threads.",1

 Heather's half-hearted and half-funny send up of the sorts of roles Hollywood has pigeon-holed her into,0
" This movie is big, exciting and funny.",1
" Having an angry Samuel L Jackson as your nasty neighbour would be anybody's idea of bad news. Tense and terrifying, this is a smart thriller.",1
" Perhaps best of all, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's creepy but tinged with sarcasm and infused with silly fun.",1
 Music biographies are best when they offer insight into an artist's life for fans and an introduction for newcomers. England is Mine offers neither.,0
 It's like spending an afternoon -- a long one -- at a beautifully lit wax-museum display inspired by earlier gangster movies.,0
 What's most disappointing here is that Kevin James appears capable of far more rich and subtle comedy than he's ever likely to be part of in a Happy Madison production.,0
" As with all of Wiseman's films, the whole is so very much greater than the sum of its parts.",1
 [Director] Marsh creates a transfixing documentary feature that doubles as a celebration of one man and an elegy to two buildings that are no more.,1

" ""Secret In Their Eyes"" seems interested in making a point about the potential hazards of giving in to one's most ardent passions, bu such a notion isn't developed by the script.",0
 The humor in The Favourite requires a level of estrangement and distance with history and the upper-class.,0

 Essentially B-movie material jacked up to a hysterical pitch by Joel Schumacher.,0
 The tale torn loyalties and brazen betrayals make for a solid thriller.,1
" If you feel uncomfortable with the film's mixture of comedy and violence, that's all to the good: director Jody Hill pushes the envelope in this often riotous genre-buster.",1
" Prose rather than poetry, basically an impersonal work without any strong directorial imprint...the new 'Straw Dogs' is superior to most of the home-invasion potboilers produced nowadays, but for real bite Sam is still 'the man.'",0
" Why does it work quite so well? In part, it's the Dench effect.",1
" A film unfortunately characterized by as much cake-and-eat-it ambivalence as those commitment challenged lovebirds. And with an ideological resolution wavering between two extremes, and in the end neither of them.",0
 Is the Millennium Trilogy over? Can we go home?,0

 What used to be an IMF team effort turned into another star vehicle for Tom Cruise.,1
" Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the dumbest mirror movie of all? Should have remained a short. ",0
" Since the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic is all about the voyeuristic instinct, the better the view, the more sensational the experience.",1
" It's cine-spirit not too far from Strictly Ballroom, Kinky Boots is a well crafted comedy that wears a solid pair of dramatic shoes to take us down the road to an entertainment with something to say.",1
" There's a deep sorrow here about the way families frequently fail to communicate, even when death is staring them in the face.",1
" Bittersweet and smart, Philomena is a character piece that carefully weaves in ugly parts of American and Irish history, a story that's as much about hatred and misused power as it is about faith and forgiveness.",1
" Watching Crowe and Gosling-who are admittedly enjoying themselves in their respective roles-is fun, but the road wears thin along the journey... ",0
" Inclusive but imperfect take on classic story of hope, love. ",1
 A patently preposterous 'true story' strictly for the very gullible.,0
" This beautiful film, anchored by non-professional actors inside of a wrecked world, is one of the most wrenchingly wonderful fantasies of 2012.",1
 A cloying high-concept melodrama which mistakes sentimentality for actual truths about the human condition.,0
 Utter hooey...more likely to leave you shaking with laughter than with fright.,0
 An impressive debut by Castillo.,1
 A surprisingly large amount of screen time devoted to the sickly sweet morality tales of the movie which would be fine on TV series...but are way too frothy and take up too much time here.,0

" This will not be for everyone -- but if you loved the foul-mouthed bear first time round, he just got even filthier.",1
" Nominally based on a 2004 nonfiction best seller by two Sex and the City writers, the movie version of He's Just Not That Into You delivers, with far less wit, the same message as the show.",0
" The film goes slack when its screws most need to tighten. Luckily, Smith - flawless in accent and commitment to Omalu's worthy cause as the NFL's worst nightmare- grips you from first to last. ",0
 Compared to this lame attempt at storytelling the first Kick-Ass is a masterpiece.,0
" While it's respectful to the Schultz legacy and periodically winning, ""The Peanuts Movie"" feels a tad stale at times, burning through established highlights instead of creating fresh ones. ",1

 Amy Adams is a star in the making.,1
" This movie has a truly uninspired premise and wallows in so much inanity that it might as well have been buried in the catacombs, too.",0
" It's not even a comedy, just an idea for one.",0
" McDonagh works way too hard to inject nearly every scene with his patented solution of acid wit and dark-roast comedy... It's jarringly effective until it starts to feel like shtick, at which point it works only as a numbing agent. ",0
" Gilroy ... is directing for the first time here, but he clearly has not only an understanding of actors, but an appreciation for image.",1
" Writer-director John Eric Dowdle makes the street action propulsive, bewildering and terrifyingly real, and things are just getting warmed up.",1
 Adding in some timely social commentary and a healthy dash of self-awareness. What results is a comedy that's even better than its predecessor.,1
 Might be the closest that the unfolding DC Universe gets to an actually enjoyable film.,1
" Smart, witty entertainment. Job done. Spit spot.",1
" This is a great endorsement of Eubank to take on larger films in the future. Should he get his hands on a more fleshed-out (and thought-through) screenplay, he may transform and adapt into a world class pop filmmaker.",1

" Kids will revel in its bright, dumb fun, even if adults will be disappointed that its terrific ensemble weren't given more to work with.",0

 Not as good as the first...but with enough hilarious Captain Jack moments and exciting action scenes to appease the fans.,1
" Doing some deft shadow boxing with the increasingly wheezy, cheesy Rocky legacy, Coogler honours its 1976 roots -- getting some poignant support from Sylvester Stallone -- while giving the franchise some relevant, rousing 21st-century direction.",1
" Composed out of almost nothing but half-measures and recycled ideas, and the result is worse than terrible: it's astoundingly mediocre and plodding.",0
" It's a good film that strives to be great, a sharp piece of noir that can't quite sucker us the way the best in the genre do.",1
" We all know the anthology's shortcomings - too little time to establish too many characters, all breadth no depth, and variable quality between chapters...Buster Scruggs is no different, bearing all of those flaws, but bearing them lightly.",1
 Also known as Voyage to the Bottom of James Cameron's Ego...the film is like a scientific version of extreme sports with Cameron as the ultimate achievement junkie... It's impossible not to be absorbed and awed.,1
" Seeing fresh, not necessarily traditional renditions of 30 classic Porter tunes done by the likes of Costello, Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Diana Krall, Lemar, Natalie Cole and Robbie Williams was a real treat.",1
" At one level, it is pretty bad. Then, on the other level, it is downright horrible. Unless you're an entertainment masochist, neither is very much fun.",0
" The plots of these films have always been nonsensical, but this one seems daft above and beyond the call of duty.",0
 The result is a film that does everything it's meant to without doing any of it all that well.,0

" Whenever Green shows up to do his semi-improvised, non-acting shtick ... this otherwise sprightly and intermittently amusing movie suddenly feels like a ship dragging its anchor.",0
" ""Passengers"" is beautiful to look at, a pretty story about pretty people in a pretty (outer space) setting, but it cannot overcome the ick factor of its premise.",0
" Delightful, inspired, affecting, utterly hilarious stuff, and certainly the first feature starring Batman to earn a couple of those compliments.",1
" More Sergio Leone than John Ford, it's a visually expansive compendium of revenge-movie cliches suffused with Scandinavian angst--not a spaghetti western, but sort of a cheesy Danish one.",0
 A cut above the recent lot of slasher films...it does not feel as if it has to cater to audiences who want every plot point spoon fed to them.,1

 The brow-furrowing over vigilante justice is as pointless as the back story of Batman that opens the movie.,0
" Runs smoothly and efficiently for its first 90 minutes, effectively mixing dark humor, social commentary, and pure story- and character-driven entertainment.",1
" The sharpest thing here is how WB marketers hyped it as a real after-school slugfest. You remember the days: 'Hey, Jones and Tiny are fighting by the flagpole at 4 o'clock.' Otherwise, it's just another lame Ice Cube or Charlie Day comedy.",0
" Colin Farrell certainly is no Clint Eastwood (who played a similar role in the 1971 original), but the ladies rule this one, including Sofia Coppola and her oddly haunting direction.",1

 Intricate and moving drama about life's struggles and near misses.,1
" In her second film, writer-director Julie Bertuccelli is sometimes partial to clumsy dialogue. But Gainsbourg and Davies, almost feral with her mass of untamed blond curls, make a memorable parent-child pair.",1

" Audiences may find reliving their own travel experiences during On the Road, enjoying the pretty scenery between the occasional nap and restroom break.",0
" This documentary about the problems and limitations of vigilante justice includes some impressive hand-held camera work, indicating bravery during firefights south of the border, and stamina while climbing very rugged terrain along the border. ",1

" The whole project feels workmanlike, an exercise in neither offending nor impressing.",0
" Xavier pauses to ask a lot of big questions, but the farcical turns of plot undermine any serious attempts to suggest answers.",0
" A film that will amaze the under-10 crowd and keep their parents distracted (and, surprisingly often, entertained) as well.",1
" This film nimbly straddles biography and ""Trek"" valentine (Adam is a longtime television director), but also recounts the fraught if ultimately devoted ties between Adam and Leonard.",1
" A beautiful, exciting and accurate portrayal of the ambivalence of human nature in hostile situations. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Takes the vaguely supernatural conceit of films like Intacto and The Cooler and drains it of all fascination, putting it in service of one of the more dim-witted romantic comedies I've had to sit through in recent months.",0
 Ritchie handles his convoluted plot and frenetic pacing with elan and sprinkles it all with liberal doses of black humor and lots of quotable dialogue.,1
 An oddly unsettling compound of glorification and malice that whirls around and winds up nowhere.,0
" Boring in the extreme, lurching along in search of diversion before fitfully delivering what the customers presumably paid to see. ",0
" It's surprising how quickly the worst elements of the film began to stack up, and do their part to tear the whole thing down. ",0
" After all, it's not like the filmmakers got everything wrong. They just didn't get the right things right.",1
" It's definitely a worthy entry -- if not one of the best -- in the Conjuring universe of horror... Annabelle: Creation should be seen late at night, in the dark.",1
 ...unappealing and flat-out annoying.,0
" The film begins with a promise, but soon you'll realise it is slipping away.",0
" Downey's Stark/Iron Man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty, but the CGI effects are amazing and, despite its length, the film is very enjoyable.",1
" Shot a few months before the student riots in Paris of May 1968, if.... captures the rebelliousness and anti-authoritarianism of the time, while raising troubling questions about where it might all be leading, and what risked being lost.",1
" Disney's first-class, straight-faced, irony-free, live-action remake of its own 1950 animated classic is a delightful explosion of colour, costumes, virtue and snarling...a truly beautiful film.",1

 This film lovingly celebrates the wonders of technology that we now take for granted.,1
" With its smart script and an ultra-likeable cast, You Me and Dupree is funny and wacky with plenty of heart, shifting focus beyond expectations ... The best part is the way the relationships between the three central characters change.",1
" Borden's exhilarating collage-like story stages news reports, documentary sequences, and surveillance footage alongside tough action scenes and musical numbers; her violent vision is both ideologically complex and chilling.",1
" While you could lean back and nod along to Refn's posturing, the film plays more like an exercise in turn-of-the-Eighties nostalgia, a movie-length strong-silent swagger inspired by the art on a VHS box.",0
" The low-budget aesthetic was probably unavoidable, but a subject like the Holodomor demands something more than a TV-movie aesthetic and pitched battle scenes featuring a couple dozen combatants ...",0
" It has vision to spare, which is rare enough in the modern cinema, and it was made by a director clearly in love with his material, which is rarer. It is not the definitive version of the musical, but maybe we don't need a definitive version.",1
" The infected just seem to bite, spit blood, scream and repeat a little too much.",0
" A regretful dud, a fantasy without magic and very little heart and soul.",0
" If ""Goodbye to Language"" (the title must be ironic, right?) were to appear without Godard's name attached, how would it be received? That's the only really interesting question provoked.",0
 The strangest $125m ever spent by a major studio.,1

" Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter pretty much succeeds as a work of magical realism.",1
" Despite the law of diminishing returns being firmly in effect, The LEGO Movie 2 is an entertaining sequel girded by spritely animation and game vocal performances.",1
" Far from a bad film, and at least two of its central trio of performances provide moments of disarming grace, but don't be surprised if a whiff of self-congratulation emanates from the screen.",1
" Grandma is a crowd-pleaser potent with Tomlin's DNA, from the razor-sharp wit in dialogue to the way the movie itself speaks to sometimes pointed, but necessary ends.",1
" An engrossing, timely film with some improvised dialogue and not a single professional actor that reveals much about hardships in Afghanistan.",1
" Peter Landesman strains to make Omalu's battles feel just and epic in scale, but the drama feels as doughy and shapeless as an athlete too long out of training.",0

" Some consider The Passenger a classic, which leads me to believe there are also people who enjoy waiting for trains that will probably never arrive.",0

" Endless implausibility, cheesy dialogue, and the inert personalities of its charisma-zapped leads conspire to doom this chilly magical mailbox love sham. Nice soundtrack, though.",0

" Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved, Ridley Scott's new Southwestern noir, The Counselor, is a jaw-dropping misfire.",0
" Did the film reels for The Man arrive at theaters with a white label with a blue stripe and the words ""action comedy"" in block letters?",0
" The fast-paced, spectacular conclusion ties the final knot in the narrative thread of this spellbinding series.",1

 The over-optimistic promise of a sequel will hopefully be one premise which remains dead and buried. For ever and ever. Amen.,0
" After racing out of the Brandenburg Gate, Ritchie bottles up all the period-flavour with no fizz; there's no real pop here to go along with the cool '60s culture. Not that the story's much more than B-rate bond. After two hours of this, you'll cry uncle.",0

" Some of the special effects are cool, but they don't compensate for the surrounding lack of drive.",0
" Sofia Coppola does have a firm aesthetic grasp on the '70s, and an even firmer emotional grasp on teenage-hood, evident in the excellent acting she has teased from the ensemble cast. But surface is not enough to make The Virgin Suicides live.",0

" For those who prefer substance over style, The Limits of Control has little to offer beyond the tedium of a half-baked storyline with undeveloped characters.",0
" Terminator Genisys tries very hard to have heart and be somewhat coherent, but it fails on most levels. At least it's fun to look at.",0

" The plentiful pop-doc touches ensure that this wake-up call won't put you to sleep, even if the ratio of spoonfuls of sugar to medicine occasionally seems skewed.",1
 One thing is clear: This documentary is more of a coronation than a portrait of a divisive figure. It would have been nice to hear the voices of anti-Hill figures who were involved in the proceedings.,0
 An instant classic.,1

 The Canyon is undermined by the expectation of a big payoff that never comes.,0
" Wright delivers an electric mash up of genres and styles, a kind of action fairy tale in which the princess is a highly trained killer, the wicked stepmother is a ruthless government agent, and there is no handsome prince or happy ending. ",1
" A mess of a movie, looking to contort Chabon's novel into a darkly personal story of choice and desire. Instead the film sloppily lumbers around in search of a consistent dramatic path. It's handsome enough, just wildly misguided from frame one.",0
" I wish the screenwriters had been 2010-minded enough to leave out the crappy gay jokes. Then again, as directed by Cusack's longtime pal and collaborator Steve Pink, and performed with manic energy by this guys-among-guys cast, the movie bops and honks.",1
 Lanthimos takes a lean and witty script about conniving women and weak men and imbues it with his own peculiar and pitiless absurdism. The result feels like an outrageously opulent cross between Dangerous Liaisons and All About Eve.,1

" An exploitation movie about people lacking even a modicum of common sense--in this case '50s era Southerners--writer/director Deborah Kampmeier's ""Hounddog"" is an insult to its audience and to the actors that signed on for her abysmal experiment.",0
" There's really only one compelling reason to see this film and that is the extraordinary performance by young Ellen Page, a breakout if ever there was one.",0
" A kind name for this attitude is false moral equivalence, or perhaps post-imperial cringe. A less kind one is Western self-hatred, or an urgent plea to tolerate the intolerant.",0

" A loud, derivative grade-Z horror film of no particular distinction.",0
" Although it drags at times and is simply too long, dampening the emotional impact of some key plot points, the fine performances -- particularly Garfield's and a fine closing scene -- will leave you thinking this Spider-Man is still kind of amazing.",1
 It's as action-packed and visually spectacular as any of its Marvel stablemates - and arguably the funniest of the lot.,1
" Annoyingly, the idea evaporates in the third act twists and turns...it's light diversion that aspires to the glory of its quirky rom-com ancestors but misses the mark by taking itself too seriously. It's also tonally off in the approach to mental illness.",0

" ... Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a multi-layered piece with such swathes of great dialogue that it will no doubt reward - if not demand - multiple viewings.",1
 Daniel Radcliffe and star-the-making Dane DeHaan deliver superb performances that tap into their character's respective insecurities.,1
" Between this ambitious epic's genuine accomplishments and its injection of color into Madeleine L'Engle's beloved fantasy novel, I really, really hate having to pronounce it a failure. Yet that's what I must do.",0
 Lives up to its title -- spend 100-plus minutes with this lacklustre thing and you definitely feel snookered.,0

" As long as the train is chugging along and the camera is on it, the film can't go wrong.",1
" n space, no one can hear you scream. But without a direct connection to the crew, why would you even bother? Scott tries to harpoon a leviathan of metaphysics with a toothpick of thought and a few barbed allusions to American culture.",1

 Chicago is entertaining in spots but could have been great.,1
" It's excerpt-ready for the Oscars, with the little blocks of conflict quickly precipitated and solved in a fast minute. The self-congratulation is thick.",0

" Although at times over-plotted and slow to get going, this sequel is bright and entertaining, with musical numbers that rock the rainforest.",1
 An engrossing if somewhat glossy drama based on a real-life heroine.,1
 The ferocity [Byrne] brings is almost enough to compensate for the limp approach the film takes to its own premise.,0
" What begins as a straightforward tale of adversity overcome, however, takes some unexpected detours en route to its defiantly non-formulaic ending.",1
" There is much to admire in this film... But it's as if the whole thing has been emotionally cauterised. It holds you at arm's length. As such, I found it peculiarly unsatisfying. If it had been a restaurant meal, I'd have come home and had a sandwich.",0
" Redemption is at its best when it focuses on action, not the after-action reports, and its best is awfully good.",1
" If you remember the lugubriously comical Bela Lugosi accent used by Jason Segel when performing his 'Dracula' puppet opera in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' you've got a notion of Daniel Day-Lewis' 'singing' voice in 'Nine.'",0
" If you undertake this movie, don't judge it as it goes along. That won't work. It's a film that demands to be seen its entirety before its impact can be felt. Sad, shattering, and unpleasant, it's too vital a work to be ignored.",1
" To watch Genisys is to see the franchise become a figurative embodiment of the Terminators themselves: convinced of its own superior vision of the future, it tramples upon the dusty skeletons of the forefathers it's slaughtered to achieve it.",0
 The cast members probably deserve some kind of special Oscar for their straight-faced delivery of such ludicrous dialogue.,0
" The Cloverfield Paradox is a worthy addition to the franchise and does a lot to connect the films, but it is also the weakest of the three films.",1
" It scores extra points for the line ""I will not retract my panda statement!"", which is as funny out-of-context as in.",1

 It isn't the dull midlife crisis movie it initially presents itself as. But it also doesn't do enough to lurch into more nightmarish territory.,0
" Wonderful film about an award-winning writer and his sacrificing wife who share a dark secret, with great performances by stars Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce.",1
" Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.",1
" The one aspect of the original Producers that still stuns is the roaring, over-the-top, in-your-face thereness of its two lead performances.",1
 It doesn't help that the film eventually loses its focus and has to fumble back to the real storyline at the very end.,0
" Wyler and Goldwyn have made a glorious 'intimate epic,' one worthy of every honor bestowed upon it.",1
" What's unclear at the end, unfortunately, is why Soderbergh really bothered with this one.",0
" Fun fare for foodies, especially those with a taste for classic French cuisine and nostalgia for the posh French restaurants that once dominated the culinary scene.",1
" In the future, maybe Bay should abandon using a screenwriter altogether and just fill up 90 minutes with disconnected images of robo-carnage.",0
" With a 1970s style so florid that you can almost smell it, we're not surprised that there's a credit for perfume in this film's opening titles...",1

 Entertaining but uneven Hollywood drama has serious themes. ,1
 A willfully oddball martial arts drama that rises above its modest station thanks to star Stephy Tang's lead performance.,1

" I'll give it this - Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is hilarious. Sadly, not intentionally so.",0
" How do films this stale and generic continue to get made, let alone with topflight talent? Cedric has been stealing scenes from bigger names for nearly a decade; he deserves better than a few amusingly-improvised minutes at the end of his own movie.",0
 One viewing sold me on its basic quality. A second look convinced me that Doubt is at least verging on something like greatness.,1
" I don't mind not thinking too hard if I'm going to get something out of it at some point, but this is more like a self-perpetuating Ouroboros loop of not thinking too hard.",0
 Audiences are guaranteed to leave the theatre smiling.,1
 The movie stacks plenty of guns and ammo but comes up short everywhere else. The action is a monotonous escalation that never dances and rarely gets down and dirty.,0
 My Super Ex-Girlfriend sets the cause of psychotic superheroines back about 30 years. The movie roils with more unexamined hostility towards women than a roomful of Taliban clerics.,0
" First they came for the dolphins, then they came for the honeybees; now they come for the songbirds. Unless we stand up for all of them, we are next.",1
" By the closing credits you too will share the characters' grief, solemnly mourning 137 minutes you'll never get back. Insufferable.",0
" Graham Greene has written a good story but the scripting is indifferent, banal at times, and the direction lacks cohesion.",1
 Trust the Maxim. Take a pass.,0
 Ready Player One reminds us yet again of Spielberg's extraordinary versatility. It is made with his customary fluency and shows an offbeat humour you wouldn't normally associate with him.,1
" It's a war story that should be felt, but instead tells you how to feel.",0
 The Absent One is a consistently engaging thriller which manages to build momentum to a violent and intense conclusion.,1
" Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom certainly benefits from its iconic, inspiring subject, but it's also too perfunctory to do him justice.",0
" The movie can be repulsive at times, but Cronenberg is more interested in ideas than in blood and guts.",1
" A roller coaster of twists and turns, crosses and double-crosses, some of which strain belief but are entertaining in an ""Oh, now I get it!"" kind of way.",1
" A grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far.",1
" This attempt at a modern-day Cinderella story is about as PC as a Career Girl Barbie and disappoints due to poor structure, flimsy characterisation and insufficient wit to distract from the above.",0
" It's hard to imagine a movie more audaciously, self-referential and just plain weirdly funny.",1
 Depicts one Afrikaner's journey toward moral responsibility in South Africa.,1
" ""Budapest"" is pretty much an old-fashioned screwball comedy garishly dressed. It's goofy, eccentric and often downright silly. There are many scenes that would have worked in a ""Three Stooges"" movie.",1
 This is a film so heavy on message that it forgets to tell the kind of rousing story it hopes to be.,1
" ""Mr. SOUL!"" is unapologetically Black, feminist, and queer. The more you learn about the show and its enigmatic host/creator, Ellis Haizlip, the stranger and cooler it is.",1

 too generic to offer many scares,0

 ridiculously cheesy,0
 [The Ritual] delivers here is a decent effort just in time for the Halloween season.,1
" The film tries so hard to be smart and funny, but... PK offers a metaphor that's too simplistic to be taken seriously.",0

 Yet another one of those films that Scream was supposed to have buried but instead resurrected.,0
" Arnie's macho crew are such an obnoxious bunch of meatheads - and that goes, too, for Mireille Enos, its lone women member - that you will struggle to care.",0
 There is a special place in movie hell for Never Say Never Again. Not that it's particularly bad -- though it's hardly good -- but because it's such a cheeseball experience with a strange and horrible pedigree.,0

" As with any shark movie, there are so many nods to the greatness of Jaws I stopped counting, but the beach scene here is a standout.",1
" Ghost in the Shell is a movie that could have been a clean sweep, but the only elements that work are those that are directly taken from the 1995 and 2004 iterations, and even they are twisted into meaninglessness. ",0

 A Wrinkle in Time was a vision. A beautiful vision that came to life and hit every note that it should've.,1
" Even though ""Boom"" doesn't pull its punches, it's still a lightweight genre picture, a patchwork comedy that makes good use of its biggest patch - Kevin James. ",1
" Loose-limbed, rascally and Texan to its bones, The Old Man & the Gun is a throwback to an era when making beautifully understated crime comedies was the peak of Hollywood's ambition (before all the spandex took over).",1

 A Most Violent Year might disappoint some viewers by stoking unfair expectations.,0
" As much about dealing with the pain of parting as an artistic memoir, this is a bittersweet delight.",1
" Choke was never going to win any prizes for subtlety, but by toning down Palahniuk's nastier absurdities in favour of obvious laughs, Gregg's adaptation is no more provocative than the average Carry On film.",0
 Doesn't register much louder than a mumble.,0

 [Zvyagintsev] continues to solidify his place as one of the most important and original voices in world cinema.,1
" The last hour or so meanders interminably, its tone wavering all over the place, leading to a quickie conclusion that feels pat. And that is such a letdown when you consider the strength and ambition of the material that preceded it.",1
" Though not quite as front-to-finish satisfying as J.J. Abrams' Mission: Impossible III, Bird's installment nonetheless rocks.",1

 Apparently it took six screenwriters to come up with a screenplay lacking a single good idea.,0

 Beyond the novelty of the setting -- which isn't even that novel when you have something similar a few exits south -- there's just not enough going on.,0
" From Ireland, this looks like yet another Hangover-style stag-night comedy, but the script has surprising depth to it, and even the sillier characters find some resonance as the events spiral into the requisite chaos. ",1

" Alex Gibney has a knack for telling great stories in a lucid fashion, and this story's a good 'un.",1
 A total nightmare. A movie that tries to mix pitch-black comedy that frequently goes to dark places with run-of-the-mill pratfalls and slapstick. None of it is funny,0
" Just the latest misguided attempt to recycle an old horror classic, replacing suspense and a sense of mystery with splatter movie cliche and heavy-handed backstory.",0

" Viggo Mortensen plays ""The Man"" (in the anonymous, Everyman sense, not in the ""Stick it to the..."" blaxploitation sense). Charlize Theron is ""Wife."" Kodi Smit-McPhee is ""The Boy."" And I'm The Audience, and I'm annoyed.",0

" It is a flawed film, but one that accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain, if in fits and starts, for an hour and a half.",1
" A mildly engrossing tale of devotion and loss, but one that passes up the chance to match the impassioned level to which its soundtrack rises.",0
 Little more than yet another foreign title that could be described as 'nice' or 'pleasant' that has been shipped over to indulge local audiences who don't want to have to think much when getting their annual foreign language fix.,0

" Miller, comics-writing icon turned director, has rendered comics-industry revolutionary Will Eisner's crime fighter Denny Colt a grim shade of dull -- all talk, no action",0
" Jones's efforts to re-tool the Italian original for an American audience prove disappointing. The comedy is broader, the dramatic crises have been sweetened and the ending has an uplift that was entirely missing from the original.",0
" Known as the screenwriter of such estimable films as ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Eastern Promises,"" Stephen Knight delivers a glorified one-act play that makes up for what it lacks in location variety and story-arc in keenly written dialogue. ",1

" This is a solid, sometimes provocative piece, although substantially more old school than the knowingly hip revisionism of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette.",1

 I simply cannot endorse a film that excuses and glorifies the abusive behavior of a rich and powerful man with a victim complex.,0
" A droll and frantic melodrama stripped of aesthetic contrivances but full of emotional ones, and it is affirming in its own way without being particularly cathartic.",1
" Because Been Rich follows a well-hoofed path, there aren't a lot of surprises, but the women make for good company.",1
 The film itself isn't awful - it packs some good lines and a few decent variations on the theme - but it can't help feeling like more of the same.,0

" The tunes, flooding every frame, remain perfect.",1
" The material is beautifully put together, and it is powerful.",1
 The entire movie is about as superficial as your average commercial,0
" Jonathan Hall's garish cinematography makes the whole movie look like a psychedelic mortuary. The screenplay, by Alan Trezza, is deadly, no pun intended.",0

 No wonder people were lined up long before midnight for the first showing.,1
 Bad acting and atrocious dialogue is topped only by the cheap shoddiness of the practical FX this demo-reel flick is meant to show off. Better they'd remained unseen.,0

 Abrams has served the fans and first-timers exceedingly well.,1
 I never stopped smirking as I watched the movie. But I would have traded all of it for half-a-dozen genuine smiles.,1
" The whole plot is incoherent, and it's depicted almost entirely through montages and crossfades.",0
" This is the kind of movie that was made by throwing dollars at stuff, as opposed to using imagination, thought or even just common sense.",0
" The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself - because it seems capable of being so much more.",1
" until they make Pink Flamingos: The Musical, we won't fully realize John Waters' talents on Broadway",1
" an utterly absorbing nightmare of a film, a precise director's evocation of a waking dream, punctuated with uncharacteristic humanity and a surprisingly optimistic ending.",1
" The film's mix of murky, up-close realism and dreamy vagueness is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's and Larry Clark's detailed, faintly voyeuristic depictions of teen life, as well Matt Porterfield's unvarnished but elegant portraits of urban disaffection.",1
 Reitman's growing legacy of wasting talent is evident again. ,0
" The parallels aren't immediately obvious and much is left to subtext, but Transit remains one of the most striking films of the past decade or so that captures the ceaseless agony of a life in hiding while the world watches in apathy.",1
" Blades of Glory doesn't pack quite the wallop of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, but it offers enough rewards to keep Ferrell fans happy.",1
" A brilliant feature-length anime that's good enough to deserve mention in the same breath as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Spirited Away.",1
" It looks great and has a firm moral backbone, but thin characters, pacing issues, and a main narrative that is less interesting than the worldbuilding bring this well-intentioned blockbuster down. ",0
" Like no Iranian movie I've seen, Tehran Taboo reveals the routine hypocrisy of people who observe and even enforce a strict religious code but secretly indulge in the pleasures of the flesh.",1
 Potter's third year is his most inventive yet.,1

" In Christopher Reeve, the casting department found someone with just the right charisma to pull it off.",1
" [The script] tends to resolve its problems by having the cast embrace, fraternity-brother fashion, and break out into full-throated ballads.",0
 A triumph. That Dr Parnassus was finished at all following the death mid-shoot of its star Heath Ledger is impressive. That it hangs together as a striking work of fantasy is truly remarkable.,1
" Beautifully eerie, yet disappointingly dull ...",0
" Morris is more interested in the pictures she's in than in England herself. He didn't need her in person to make this film. Yet there she is, dragged in to redeem herself so she can be admitted into humankind.",0
" As a whole, it does not quite work, especially at the end, when Mr. Chan tries for a Shakespearean climax of filial rebellion and paternal rage.",0
" From this vantage point, what's most miraculous is that, almost by accident, Lambert and Stamp corralled the chaos of four unsightly, sulky talents and fashioned it into something for the ages.",1
 There's a thin line between clever and stupid. NIc Cage walks it.,1
" Only God Forgives delivers what we might have thought we wanted but with diminishing returns: Refn's trademark visual style is indulged to a dizzying degree but is unmoored, lacking any kind of satisfying or coherent narrative throughline.",0
" Onstage, there was so much glamour I couldn't decide whom to concentrate on. In the movie, they're so obnoxious I just wanted them to shut up and go home. The movie is busy, but in their failed homage to Fellini, they've lost his mystery and humor.",0
 Let the sentiment reveal itself. Don't veer into sentimentality. Don't push. Just trust the story. That's the whole trick with a movie like Everybody's Fine.,1
 The Intern is repulsive.,0
" While the ever-game star jogs around quaint European landmarks with a look of mild consternation, director Ron Howard struggles to inject real urgency into proceedings.",0
 It's 90-plus minutes in a live-action Hanna-Barbera hell. It's directed by the man who gave us Home Alone 3. It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. with a blonde dye-job. I'm not at all sure that anyone needs to know any more about it than that.,0
" The subtitle to The Meyerowitz Stories both displays and subtly mocks the literary ambitions of Noah Baumbach's thoroughly delightful new movie, which some might call a Squid and the Whale played for laughs.",1
 drags along too slowly to give it much impact and instead engenders little more than impatience,0
" Despite nifty F/X, first-time director Ellory Elkayem's staging is altogether devoid of variation.",0
 A totally beguiling Swedish film about the coming-of-age of a 10-year-old girl during a summer when her parents and brother are gone. ,1
" It's OK. It's not a disaster. And it doesn't vindicate the naysayers. This film fails to fly not because it stars women, but because that's the only good idea it had.",0
" Despite some admirably gory bits, this is a disappointing horror remake that's neither as scary nor as funny as it thinks it is.",0
 Owen is able as Arthur but it is Knightley's Guinevere who steals the show.,1
" Though the film's story technically meets the definition of 'new,' little in it will offer up the feeling that word evokes.",0

" [Although] I think Holofcener's work is always interesting, I think this is the least satisfying of all her films I've seen.",0
" A slightly more serious take on the rom-com, this film benefits hugely from its likeable cast even though the script lets frequently them down.",1
 t is reporting rather than illuminating. But it is watchable and modestly entertaining.,1
" Okay, so it's less po-faced and mean-spirited than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, more colourful, varied and inventive than Man Of Steel. It's probably the least-worst DC movie so far. But these are not the (anti) heroes we were waiting for.",0
 A Star is Born is American mainstream cinema at its very finest.,1
 1408 amounts to little more than a radical shock-therapy session for a man still finding his way after the loss of his daughter. Best to leave him alone with his issues.,0
 Jacob Estes' film starts from an interesting premise and proceeds to be as predictable as possible. ,0
 This is one of the better movies about the gambling culture in recent years.,1
 Screenwriters Jason Dean Hall and Barry Levy swipe plot twists from the film adaptations of best-selling author John Grisham's novels.,0
" Still, while it's disappointing as a mystery, ""Who Killed Cock Robin"" is effective as the study of a compulsively nosy man who follows his hunches whenever they lead, into some dark places.",1
" Mark Lewis' fascinating-if-niche documentary intersperses great 3D shots of these glistening, gobbling Jabbas with testimonies from boffins and crackpots.",1
" An agonizingly strained attempt at misanthropic comedy, ""Bad Santa 2"" is puerile when it should be shocking, calculating when it should be transgressive, and listless when it should be liberating. The desperate crassness of the whole endeavor galls.",0
 Director Kaare Andrews' and screenwriter Jake Wade Wall's interminable set-up is hardly worth the uninspired rollout of the second half's carnage follies ...,0
 The Club is written and acted with great skill and remarkable sensitivity to the warped thought processes of paedophiles and their victims.,1
" It remains to be seen whether Jigsaw can hook in new generations of horror fans or bring back the crowds which supported the highly profitable earlier films, but this genuinely is a fitting jumping-on point for the Saw saga.",1
" Million Dollar Arm is a dithering, uncertain film from an era of dithering uncertainty, when baseball has become a thriving global enterprise but long ago lost its aura of specialness in American life.",0
" De Niro seems tired, Pacino's only half interested, and the gritty New York City milieu only serves to remind you of better days and much better movies.",0
 A poignant movie with a much calmer idea of happiness than the average sports movie.,1
 The movie does wield crude and considerable power.,1
" The asylum material is gripping, as are the scenes of Jia with his family.",1
" A movie of limited intrinsic merit, and about which it's difficult to make any positive claim for its quality stronger than that it's definitely better than Mockingjay Part 1.",0
" What happens when a famously seat-of-the-pants director goes to work for a notoriously detail-oriented filmmaker? Unsurprisingly, in the case of ""Alita: Battle Angel,"" a big mess, though an exhilarating one.",1
 A comedy with considerable depth about people who suffer despite their living amid the splendor of one of the most fashionable areas of the world.,1
 Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the sort of movie that ends up on a person's favourite-movies-of-all-time list. It's really that fresh.,1
" The poor-woman's-Nora-Ephron template is followed here, right down to the super-generic title and the dependence on a genuinely engaging cast to sell flimsy material.",0
 An iconic performance packaged in a film good enough to support it. ,1
 Pacino captures the mind-boggled look of someone who has not achieved REM state in days.,1
" Man of Steel is a chill-inducing visual spectacle that is absolutely Herculean in nature with a downright glorious performance by Michael Shannon, an epic score, and extremely intense action.",1
" If a filmmaker attempted to combine everything casual moviegoers don't like about superhero franchises, they couldn't come up with a picture as execrable as this one.",0
 A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort.,0
" As a panel in the output of versatile helmer Scott, this prequel is detail-oriented but it's too serious, grim and verbose, posited between Kingdom of Heaven (a flop) and Gladiator, which while not great, offered pleasures that the new picture denies.",0
 Indisputably comes off as a minor work on the heels of Malick's The Tree of Life but still holds enough of interest for the initiated.,1
" This is a movie that tries to be that great war film, as well as a star-crossed romance and a political thriller, without really succeeding on any front.",0
 As an after-thought [director Louis] Leterrier and his producers decided to make the flick 3-D. But oops - they'd already shot like 90% in ordinary old 2-D.,0
" In Fear is a slickly made, impressively pared-down horror/thriller but is too abstract for its own good - it is hard to feel any great emotional identification (or fear) for characters who so sketchily written.",0
" The more desperate the characters' flight becomes, the less interesting the movie grows.",0
" After watching ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,"" I wanted to revisit ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" for its realism.",0
" A disturbing, darkly funny, and nightmarish cinematic gem.",1
 A beautiful movie wrapped around a moving story --- one that should not be missed.,1
" Suffice it to say that I don't understand the rave reviews that this picture received, and I was not a happy camper when I left the theater.",0
" The surfing scenes are spectacular. Unfortunately, those scenes cover about 30 minutes of a badly written, mostly boring 90-minute film.",0
 The fight against cyber-terrorism couldn't be more topical and the film is as stylish and strikingly well-made as we have come to expect from Mann.,1

 An appealing film reveals the bright side of retirement for three men.,1
" By removing any ""extreme for extreme sake"" motivations from the conversation, Free Solo's climax becomes a breathtaking, vertigo-inducing, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride.",1
 Applause offers no softening euphemisms -- but plenty of sharp humor -- in its depiction of a gifted artist struggling to reform herself as she rages against the vulnerabilities of middle age.,1
" Farhadi piles on plot twists and sensational revelations until we realize what we're watching is soap opera packaged as art. Five or ten minutes into hour three, the film reaches a critical mass of preposterousness.",0
" Pretty animation, weak jokes and a message that feels downright sinister. ",0
 Who knew a Spanish accent could make Woody's familiar neurotic dialogue sound fresh?,1
 Bruce McDonald's latest is a genre-freak-only affair that even at 81 minutes feels like a joke that takes much too long reaching its punch line.,0
 It's very strong.,1
 Director-writer Jody Hill wants it both ways -- as absurdist comedy and serious character study -- and falls short twice.,0
 The American is not a film which explains everything. That's half the beauty of it.,0
" It's a riveting film, depressing in its critique of a system that was built on greed and fraud - and rebuilt after the crash with taxpayers' money, only to continue its brazen practices today",1
" Sure, it's a literary classic, but when you translate that to film, doesn't it usually mean stodgy, old-fashioned and, above all else, boring? Not in this case.",1
 Doctor Strange is mostly a blast.,1
 'Super 8' can be simplified as 'E.T.' meets 'Cloverfield'... [it] truly is the beginning and the end of summer blockbusters...,1
" A high-spirited, genial romp that's suffused with a becoming innocence.",1
" The series becomes more cosy with each instalment. We know that disputes within the team will be resolved in time for a final communal celebration, all but negating the original premise of thrillseekers leading reckless lives in proximity to death.",0
" ARGO is a perfect combination of storytelling, smarts and suspense. ",1
" Double Lover has the gloss of high-minded art, and the soul of pure sleaze.",0
" Satoshi Kon has created a taut, tense thriller that's a lot more coherent than many sci-fi animes, and deftly weaves several levels of reality up until the twist ending.",1
" Most contemporary sci-fi movies come on with all CGI-guns blazing, trying to blow the roof off the theater. Moon settles for trying to blow your mind instead.",1
" A sprawling, emotionally absorbing tale of young love from Franco-Tunisian auteur Abdellatif Kechiche.",1
" An entertainingly off-kilter slice of pulpy mainstream filmmaking, executed with humour, verve and vision.",1
 The movie offers few thrills but will provide some great screen-savers.,0
" Liam Neeson is at it again in yet another enjoyable, disposable French-produced action flick in which a hapless, dishevelled guy with big personal problems is forced by circumstance to jump, run, growl and shoot people - often all at the same time.",1
 This is like making a movie about a prizefighter who hardly boxes... ,0
" There's undeniable craftsmanship here, especially in Fassbender's confident and transformative performance, but Sorkin's script fails to shout and quip its way to anything approaching dramatic vibrancy.",0
 Zemeckis shows he still has a vivid visual sensibility and a finger on the zeitgeist. But the script by John Gatins leaves nothing up in the air and returns all the tray tables locked in their upright positions.,1
" My new favorite freaky thing is the wack-eyed mantis shrimp, a testy little fellow who gets violently territorial with crabs loitering around his front door - as one learns to its grief. Get off my lawn, punk.",1
" Relentless, shocking, and admirably experimental.",1
" If you're willing to loosen your grip on reality, it is a grand journey to a place where Gothic is cross-wired with modern sensibilities.",1
" Entertaining enough bio-pic that, for the most part, avoids the over-treacly elements. ",1
 Supernatural-themed comedy lacks spark.,0

" An airlessly insular film, with too much concentration on minute details.",0
" Never for a frame less than gorgeous to the eye, its beauty saves these beasts.",1
" There comes a point when it becomes difficult to take Salt seriously. That would be fine if this was an intentional parody of action spy thrillers, but it's not.",0
 A fascinating study of a newspaper doing its best to not just survive but to continue to do so with excellence while the world tilts beneath the venerable broadsheet.,1
" The power of love can only do so much in Disney's misbegotten A Wrinkle in Time...across the board, this disappointing Time will cause more than a little wrinkling of the forehead in frustration.",0
 The film also conveniently omits the fact that many other Arabs supported the Germans. That smoothing out of complex issues makes Indigenes more of a simple crowd pleaser than a genuinely challenging film.,0
" The director's clear-minded approach allows her subject's more challenging aesthetic-political mix to shine through, even if it's at the inevitable expense of her own filmmaking proclivities.",1
" For those who thought No Country For Old Men was too lightweight and resolved itself too neatly, behold the abyss that is A Serious Man.",1
" Colin, darling, you were fabulous, completely on trend. Plot? So last season, it's nowhere to be seen - we're all about character, emotion and cheekbones, sweetie.",1
" Is this a satire on amoral violence or a celebration of it? Regrettably, it's the latter, which should give you some idea of just how despicable this film is.",0
" REPLICAS can't decide which note it wants to play, so it slams on them all in random order. REPLICAS exists as the kind of movie that raises lots of interesting - if oft-asked - questions and then immediately ditches them.",0
 Good performances and striking looks are meaningless if your story falls apart when the tensions should be ratcheting up to unbearable level,0
" The word ""beguiling"" came to mind throughout.",1
 This is mostly lame and grating stuff that almost dares you to laugh.,0

" Inevitably, the film has the air of an extended campaign ad, but that doesn't make its subjects and the stories they tell any less compelling.",1
 Drama about the controversial information freedom fighter made worth seeing by Benedict Cumberbach's tour de force performance.,1
" A brief but entertaining addition to the series canon. Disney's Blu-ray release comes with an audio commentary, three more ""Toy Story"" short films, and a bunch of other worthwhile extras. An engaging package that is easily recommendable.",1

 One of those self-indulgent messes only a very talented but screwed up auteur could make when he hits rock-bottom. ,0
 There's more drama in one track from Live at the Apollo than 139 long minutes of this.,0
" The end result is dramatically inert, a showcase for James Franco's technically adept but entirely unilluminating impression of Allen Ginsberg.",0
" Does a great injustice to the skill of misdirection by turning elaborate deception into blunt blockbuster filmmaking, perverting sleight of hand beauty into moronic CGI-drenched escapades where anything goes.",0

 Bland and boring are not the adjectives you hope for from a movie starring Josh Holloway as an alcoholic coaching a team of young breakdancers to the world championship (in 3D!).,0
" It's a harrowing and beautiful movie, brilliantly executed, and does justice to its subject. I hope you will reward writer/director Paul Greengrass for his efforts. Not at all exploitative.",1

" Life desperately wants to let Murphy and Lawrence be actors, but it can't imagine them as anything more than rowdy showmen.",0

 It wants audiences to know it's in on the joke though it's not always apparent that there even is a joke in the first place.,0

" Violent fun, punctuated by laugh out loud moments and unexpectedly strong drama. ",1
" Nigh-on unforgivable. An all-fumbling, all-bumbling, all-trundling crock of crud, that's not so much Snatch in a Deerstalker as bum on a flagpole.",0
" This richly conceived powerhouse drama about life and death is ultimately about the search for a sense of family, whether in peace or war, and what binds humans together despite the most unendurable horrors at hand.",1

 Zac Efron gives one of his most credible and intriguing performances in this winningly stupid frat comedy.,1

" A paint-by-numbers affair that is not only tired, but looks as if it was written by a computer program.",0
" Takes an idea that also happens to be a MESSAGE, in a genre that has been sucked dry, and still make something watchable. It's not the most brilliant vampire movie ever made, but it's the best one of 2010.",1
 Achbar and Abbott would have had a first-rate film had they stuck with their conceit -- corporations as inmates running the asylum -- but they dilute their case in an attempt to make it irrefutable.,0
" Well paced, but rarely charged.",0
" The disjointed stories feel like pages from Allen's sketchbook, riffs from underdeveloped story ideas thrown together haphazardly.",0
" Moretti here mostly meanders agreeably but toothlessly, parting the veils of ecclesiastical pomp and bureaucracy and finding nothing more subversive than a rejected thespian suffering from an extreme case of stage fright.",0

 It glorifies the most conspicuous of consumption... But then it delivers a message about the importance of remaining untainted by wealth. Not the most palatable turnaround.,0
" While often both funny and perceptive, it's less than memorable, and a weak ending reduces it to more of a time-filler than a movie that's truly worthwhile.",0

" If everybody is identically manufactured and therefore dead inside, do we really need a joyless film to confirm that fact for us? ",0
" Wiseman's methodology favors the vocal, so we hear more from the choreographers and the directors than we do from the actual performers, and that somewhat throws off the balance of what we learn about the goings-on here.",1

 It's not just what he does. It's who he is. And he approaches it with such unbridled passion and joy that you can't help but sharing in it; absolutely no knowledge or love of fashion is required.,1
" By film's conclusion, Drillbit is a mock hero at best, and the few bits of comedy have been overshadowed by viciousness.",0

" Sorrentino delivers a gloriously magical movie, a road film crossed with a fiftysomething coming-of-age piece, with side trips to the land of the eccentric.",1

 A warm bath in comfortable platitudes.,1
 A moving tribute to a peerless talent.,1
" ""Annabelle: Creation"" carries no forward momentum. There's no ticking clock. No kidnapped victim to save. No mystery to solve. The characters snoop around and then wait for something bad to happen. Then they do it again.",0
" At a time when financial regulations have been gutted, stock market indexes reel, and trade wars threaten, Jed Rothstein's slick and revealing documentary ""The China Hustle"" should only add to the anxiety and gloom.",1

" Even with too much focus on the former character, Frank & Lola, buoyed by Shannon's performance and Ross' acute eye for the seediness of his environments, is a commendable debut.",1
 Soderbergh's film clears a new space for the playing out of human dreams and desires.,1

 I went to see a new Argentine movie and a 1990s Whit Stillman movie broke out. I'm not complaining at all.,1

 The dramatic events of the 1976 Formula One Championship are played out as superficial rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. ,1
 It makes you feel truly alive to the possibilities of life. That's an act of magic.,1
" It has very little of [Moulin Rouge]'s irreverence or nose-thumbing spirit, opting instead for a stubborn adherence to the tenets of the budget-busting Hollywood prestige pictures of the 1950s and 1960s.",0
 The film's horrific and important subject matter is distilled into a lackluster lump of generic buddy-movie/road-picture components.,0
" I actually enjoyed it. Not in an ironic way, or with a 'so bad it's good' energy. I thought Venom was a solid, engaging--yet flawed--superhero movie. I don't understand it, either.",1

 Start cheering because The Damned United is the first great football movie and it's going to be bigger than Clough's head.,1
 An enjoyably slippery suspense thriller that tugs our sympathies this way and that while springing narrative twists and traps with stomach-lurching suddenness.,1
" A movie about fast cars that makes 'The Fast and the Furious'...look literate and clever...hilariously melodramatic muscle-car camp, unbearably loud and extremely stupid.",0

" Some cute moments with the likable leads, but it's just too flimsy overall.",0
 Lincoln's cast gets high marks for making the film more entertaining than it has any right to be.,1
 It proves again that films made for grown-ups can be more nimble-footed and fresh-faced than anything aimed at the youth market.,1
" Generally, the film feels like it is authentic.",1
" If terrible movies were car crashes, this 101-minute horror-show is a coachload of orphans slamming headlong into the Hoover Dam - and 2010 is unlikely to serve up anything worse.",0
" John Travolta returns as the reformed mobster he played in Get Shorty. But while Get Shorty rode the Pulp Fiction craze with finesse, Be Cool is running on empty.",0

 It is hard to empathize with the petty problems of people living in luxurious houses the size of hotels when so many people in American have lost their homes.,0
" The script is an unholy mess, stumbling between comedy, action, horror and romance, without any clue how to navigate these shifts in tone.",0
" The movie makes direct fun of standard Hollywood storytelling conventions, and that's enjoyable. But its utter lack of narrative discipline is just plain amateurish, not subversive.",0
" so awkwardly assembled, so self-seriously preachy that it's actually exhausting to watch",0

" An extremely cold, creepy and brilliant examination of the spookiest edges of the male psyche.",1
" The joyous movie Battle of the Sexes covers every inch of the court -- as an inspirational sports drama, as a riotous comedy, as a tender romance and as an insightful biography of King and her pivotal role in the fight for women's equality.",1
" As a slow-burn, poetic character piece it works just fine, with Dorff and especially Fanning making engaging leads.",1
" There are noticeable holes in the plot, but the action is plentiful. Director Edward Zwick and writer Richard Wenk do a nice job with the pace of the film and keeping the tone light enough. It is an agreeable popcorn film.",1
 Far more of a mediocre Split sequel than a continuation of Unbreakable/new exploration of Glass. ,0
 Mendes can't entirely surmount the smugness that pollutes Eggers and Vida's picaresque script.,0
" Sadly, Noer's Papillon is a grittier but largely generic addition to the popular prison drama subgenre.",0

 Epic is heavy on celebrity voices and light on imagination.,0
" The film's ostentatiousness never overshadows the brilliantly complex lead performance by Dorval, who runs the gamut from tacky gusto to cynical calculation.",1
 Gets bogged down with too many endless fight scenes and too many characters to juggle.,0
 A deceptively small movie that sneaks up and slays you with its emotional authenticity.,1
" What does this new version offer? A different set of actors, a Valentine's Day release date and kissing. Lots of kissing. Kissing in place of character development and dialogue, even entire kissing montages where a meaningful plot should be.",0
" [I]t works wonderfully well to make this movie Nancy a bit of a retro throwback. This is how you make a girl stand out today: you make her polite, enthusiastic, bookish, sweet, and wholesome.",1
" ...the meat of this film is the nature of a relationship between two people, and you're free to go as deep, or not, into that as you wish.",1
" Meyers' films have always been about basically decent people navigating life's various hurdles. Here, though, her characters have gone from ""It's Complicated"" to ""It's Pretty Straightforward, Actually.""",0
 This Japanese teen love story from Naomi Kawase is mired in emo histrionics and limp drama.,0
" ...a movie that fails for much the same reason the 2003 Ben Stiller/Drew Barrymore vehicle Duple"" did.",0
" There are so many missed opportunities for interesting sci-fi elements, but this movie isn't interested in that. It's a military ground war action film, and even that isn't sustainable. ",0
" There's no question that you will laugh at times throughout ""Burt Wonderstone."" But if you are looking for something truly magical, you will come away disappointed.",0
" Fuqua tries to create the illusion of meaning by copycatting the style and techniques of better directors, but he can't save the naked emperor of the script.",0

" Believe the bad buzz on this houseflies-become-astronauts CG animation, which is lousy with lazy jokes and irritating characters.",0
" Nemes can be relentlessly opaque, which at time makes the film a drag to follow. But there's method in his determination to leave us with nowhere to park our own affinities.",1
" ""I'm probably missing some great Internet snark right now,"" [Annie] whines. ""#boring."" Alas, the same hashtag can be applied to Turkey Hollow at times.",0

" A hugely enjoyable, if predictably rose-tinted look at the history of the world's biggest and most enduring film franchise.",1
" Rather than suggesting a director trying something new, Desplechin's first outing in the US seems to have robbed him of his personality.",0
 Oblivion is just a hot mess of a movie.,0
" Whether it's Baldwin speaking or the readings done by Samuel L. Jackson, I Am Not Your Negro pulls no punches. It's painful for a society that declares itself to be educated to be forced to look at how ignorant it has been and remains.",1
" Even with Mara and Segel in the lead, The Discovery is unable to make a somewhat interesting story; that initial compelling idea is wasted in this dull and stale sci-fi film.",0
" A stodgy, ridiculous movie with a horse that simultaneously serves as an allegory for the bond that unites all mankind and as a symbol of profound, idealized purity.",0
" Though The General (1927) is still considered Keaton's masterpiece, Steamboat Bill Jr. is gaining considerable momentum.",1
" This light-hearted caper is brightly coloured and up-tempo, featuring plenty of cool gadgets and baddie-vs-baddie hijinks.",1
 The basic narrative problem here is that there's more backstory than story. Cooper's supposedly deeply flawed wheeler-dealer comes off more like a bland frat boy with a Coppertone tan.,0
" The idea of the man-boy who can't commit is rather '90s, and neither the film's narrative nor style brings it forward two decades, to where it should be.",0
" ""Will have you howling with laughter, unable to stop even to catch breath.""",1
 The film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonder--the thing that should be Spielberg's forte.,1
" While there is still some flicking at the book's more human themes of best-intentioned familial deceit, forgiveness and healing, they're all but blotted out by Gilles Paquet-Brenner's slapdash direction.",0
 It doesn't matter if you don't like subtitles. It doesn't matter if you've never heard of the director. It doesn't matter if you've never seen a Chinese movie in your life. It will make you laugh. Guaranteed.,1
" Reluctant to film the great work, Sangsoo continues to explore the fusion of film and life camouflaging the complexity of lightness. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" Billy's schoolmates are either implausible (the jock who quotes Oscar Wilde) or one-dimensional (Abigail Breslin's Trump-ite cheerleader who insists 'all gays are going to hell'), though Laverne Cox lights up the screen with a fleeting cameo.",0
" Shannon reteams with Shotgun Stories writer-director Nichols for another exploration of one man's wobbling mental state. But this time the story is much more introspective, and watching it is thoroughly unnerving.",1
 The characters are not consistent and behave crazily in order to advance what little plot there is.,0
" [Ridley Scott's] primary interest seems to be that of all ""generals in the arts,"" to wow us with action set pieces garnished with bits of faux-profundity and Cliff's Notes historicity.",0
 The story is ridiculously complicated.,0
" Shame the flick's just a one-note joke because, sight unseen, Bad Teacher had me at the title.",0
 GODZILLA poaches a lot of imagery from JURASSIC PARK and then simply amplifies it under its self-promoted precept 'Size Does Matter',1
" This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) just pound away.",0
" ...by hanging its oddball characters on the most obvious of plots, it dilutes the weirdness that would have made it unique.",0
 The director made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the magical feeling of the play...,0
" Bitty and frequently batty, Nine doesn't have the sultry cogency or louche mellifluousness of Chicago. But it will do for Christmas '09.",1
 The fascination of the film lies in its painstaking observation of the hapless lovers and of the world around them.,1
" The movie never feels like a nostalgia trip. It moves, breathes and sings with life.",1
" This production, these situations and characters, are to Shakespeare what advertising is to truth.",0
" It's bigger. It's louder. And, like the title says, it's bad.",0
" Loving has a big, powerful story at its fingertips but only scratches the surface of telling it.",0
" It is, however, such a spectacular-looking movie, as shot by cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding that it is, to use that old cliche, worth the price of admission.",1
" If its shape and trajectory are quickly mapped out, Jimenez hauls in punchy story and character beats ...",1
 This is a respectful and complex work of fiction around the concepts of the biblical character and his life.,1
" Neeson carries the baggage of all his past revenge movies, and thus his presence detracts from the sardonic tone of the piece more than it adds.",0
 It doesn't seem to display much of a point of view at all.,0

 A glorious edge-of-seat affair,1
" Despite the Cronenbergian themes, the film is relentless and singleminded: It just wants to scare you, and it succeeds.",1
" The Jungle Book features some of the more astounding visuals in recent film. For a film that's overwhelmingly digital, there's a remarkably tactile quality to so many of the film's setpieces.",1
" Has its inspiring moments - especially given the true story - and some tense, dramatic scenes amid the speedy montages of confusing gang action.",1
" There is nothing fun about Sith, except maybe the opening space battle, and it's not so much an adventure as an ordeal.",0
 Cruise's witty banter is crowded out by special-effects overkill.,0
" While the extraordinarily talented Polish-born director rarely falters in translating the source's theatrical strengths, his Venus in Fur feels oddly impersonal, lacking the trademark touch of Polanski perversity.",1
 Who knew a bunch of NBA all-stars could turn out to be so funny and such good comic actors? Uncle Drew scores on many fronts as the surprise feel good movie of the summer.,1
 Director Stanley Kubrick's amazing marriage of music and images - seen at its absolute best in the space ballet of the capsule docking to the strains of Strauss' Blue Danube waltz - points to what we can achieve as a species when we put our minds to it.,1
 Gone is the vulnerability that Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara brought to the character - easily one of the 21st century's most admired feminist heroines - and gone is the cultural subtext that David Fincher buried beneath his icy version.,0
" As comedies go, it's actually fairly funny, albeit in a light, superficial way which either hides or exposes the fact that the plot is a thick tangle of mutual contradictions.",1
" Donaldson's film, about a dangerous crime during a tumultuous time period, suffers from a filmmaker utterly uninterested in dangerous filmmaking.",0
" Not only one of the best films of 2009, but one of the best gay-themed films ever...The most authentically detailed period film since 2002's ""Far from Heaven""",1
 A cast of exceptionally appealing performers and some very funny lines are not enough to make this raunchy comedy overcome its essential charmlessness.,0

 Insightful drama shatters post-9/11 stereotypes.,1
" By the end, Knock Knock turns into a punch-line for a very bad joke.",0
" The story of freedom from oppression and freedom of expression in Iran is a somber and ruthless one, but you'd never know the true extent of it by seeing this film.",0
" With McDormand as the Greek Chorus for the left side of hatred and Rockwell the bumbling bumper sticker for the right side of hatred, it's unfortunate that Harrelson's Sheriff is eventually reduced to a deus ex machina character.",0
 The script flattens the main characters and makes one nostalgic for Flaubert's observational acumen.,0
 The film has a big heart to go along with its gutter-oriented mind...,1
" It's endlessly arguable and open for debate. At the very least, we can all agree that Banksy has found a new wall on which to plaster his art -- that of the silver screen.",1
" Under the generous debut direction of Damon Cardasis, there's enough heart and raw truth here to uplift the moments that falter.",1
" Winehouse was a complicated artist who deserved a nuanced, honest look at her life. In lesser hands, Amy could be a feature-length E! True Hollywood Story, but Kapadia treats his subject with respect and heart.",1
" A clanking, old-fashioned period drama infused with almost unbearable grief, Claude Miller's film A Secret has an enormous significance in France that it can never possess elsewhere.",1
" The problem is that both lead characters are interminably dull, with the camera's gaze repeatedly dwelling on their mundane private moments and imploring us to be intrigued.",0
" Better than the second film in the franchise, this film is still as hollow and unimportant as its predecessor.",0
" Lanthimos' renegade deviltry turns a period piece into a bawdy, brilliant triumph. Expect Oscar to bow down to Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and the mighty Olivia Colman as Queen Anne for bringing a #MeToo punch to 18th-century British politics.",1
 Escape from Planet Earth doesn't even try to make itself memorable. It's like a generic case of really uncomfortable indigestion that you'll forget about as soon it ends.,0
" The middle-class kids chose the wrong prank. A seven-year sentence is a dandy proscenium breaker.... And we, the audience, get to vicariously experience an entertaining cautionary tale.",1
" The movie itself apparently isn't sure the murders themselves are lurid enough. So it adds a few things that didn't happen, plus some 21st-century music.",0
" This movie, an old-fashioned morality play masquerading as a kinetic video-game in space, understands some basic truths about youngsters.",1
" Riklis, working from an adaptation of a popular novel by the Arab-Israeli writer Sayed Kashua, is wryly perceptive of the ways each side exoticizes and demonizes the other.",1

 Buried in the year-end rush but one of the year's best films.,1
" The ending is frustrating, but as a character study it's both powerful and provocative.",1
" Hopefully, Burger has the good sense to bail before he does any further damage.",0
" Tedious and overblown - as though the filmmakers were so preoccupied with ""updating"" the material that they forgot what made it so popular in the first place.",0
" This documentary gives us a paper-thin authorised version of his story. There's a hint of more interesting stuff below, but director Adrian Buitenhuis never looks like going there.",0
" Valiant may not fly in the stratosphere of Pixar or the best of DreamWorks, but giving these plucky birds their due is not a bad way to wind up the summer.",1
" Erlingsson makes striking use of Iceland's volcanic landscapes as he links a collection of stories on love, death, loyalty, suffering and sacrifice in which magnificent horses play a central role.",1
" Daniel Day-Lewis gives yet another performance for the ages in Steven Spielberg's admirably literate, thoroughly charming biopic.",1
" If the sorry state of Hollywood comedy could use a boost from a pep squad, it's let down by the droopy Fired Up!",0
 [Solid] performances took me over some of the bumps of the movie.,1
" The movie gets stuck in a seemingly never-ending cycle of pointless, recycled racial jokes and ethnic stereotypes.",0
" Oh, the hilarity of hating your family at the holidays.",0
" It promises spectacle and action but fails to deliver all that much of either, and ends up being so dull it can't even be enjoyed for its camp value.",0
" Gibney assembles a damning case against the athlete, but what distinguishes this from other accounts of the scandal is the filmmaker's admission that, while shooting a documentary about Armstrong's 2009 comeback, he smothered his own innate skepticism.",1
 Devalued-dollar documentary drives home the point that a country which consumes more than it produces is unsustainable.,1
" I really don't know who I would recommend this film to. It's worth seeing for Crowe's performance, I guess, but for pity's sake don't pay anything for it.",0
" Considering the narrative rope-a-dope in the first act, including a confusing and needless framing device that makes the film feel like a victim of post-production tinkering, it is occasionally entertaining and occasionally engrossing despite itself. ",0
" Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead is even more fun than its predecessor, thanks to tight pacing, clever plotting, and an expanded mythology that stays true to its aura.",1
 Any movie that starts with the subject assaulting the director (Baker smacks plucky first-timer Jay Bulger squarely in the face with his cane) is already ahead of the game.,1
" The movie subverts expectations, and not in a good way, by seeming in a dither about its own identity.",0
" Ultimately, it's as conventional as the romantic-comedies it mocks. Still, fans of the stars should get satisfaction.",0
 It's not the worst Stephen King movie but it is one of the most forgettable. The writer's wild imagination has been flattened for a quick shot at a family hit.,0
" If there's an award for taking a great idea and strangling it to death with mediocre execution, this should get it.",0
" Bottom line: The movie is terrific, just the breath of fresh air Warners needs.",1
" If it falls short of its ambitions, you have to love that it tries to go for the big story, and that it gives Elle Fanning such a grand role at her tender age.",1
" Bay's fascistic tendencies aren't quite as pronounced as in the last installment, but there isn't anything this man won't do for the sake of arousing himself.",0
 Cecil Beaton is the name and hagiography's the game in this documentary portrait that collapses at the feet of its subject.,0
" A likable and fittingly strong cast carries this remarkable story, which is not exactly remarkably told. Let's call it more trigger happy than memorable.",1
" McKellen puts an indelible stamp on Holmes. He gives us a more seasoned, crankier Holmes, a former detective who's trying to stop a decaying mind from turning his own life into an unsolved mystery.",1
" This indie comedy could have been a brutal yet endearing midwestern cult classic a la Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), but instead it's petty and repulsive. ",0
" Last Vegas is all glitz and glamor, forgetting there's more to a production than flashy lights and headlining names.",0
" An unclassifiable but strangely charming combination of reminiscence and fantasy, this is worth seeking out not only for Anderson fans but also for anyone interested in experimental cinema.",1
" Any time you see the words ""human spirit"" attached to a movie, run for the hills. You're about to see a manipulative film in which the scrappy underdog wins against impossible odds.",0
 A flawed but masterful film.,1
 It's immediately apparent why [Clara Bow] was so beloved.,1
 Evening's take on defining life choices reveals its manic depressive nature.,0

 Sarah Polley's passion-drunk film about a summertime flirtation is a lovesick daze of lust and pain and regret.,1

" Like the original, Tron: Legacy obsesses over technology and style but forgets important details like character and plot.",0
" Hammering home its simplistic political messages as only Disney (and co-writer Damon Lindelof) can, director Bird's film has its moments, but mostly feels so yesterday.",0
" If you think The Ritual is like every other movie, just have a little patience. I assure you it's not. Insanely creepy 'horror in the woods'. [Full review in Spanish].",1
" Physical comedy and accidental drug-taking are all well and good, but at this point, they're modern staples of the genre that Life of the Party does little to reinvent.",0
" For all its avowed interest in life -- as in, you know, the biological imperatives of our existence -- its characters seem acquainted only with television.",0
" I can see the epic tragic scope that Cimarron was going for, and I can glean the dramatic irony inherent in the hugeness of it all, but it just doesn't work. It's a stiff, unengaging movie.",0
 'Smurfs 2' joins many other live action/animation mixes as an average outing for the smaller fry. ,0

" If you didn't love Grace Jones before, then you will after watching Grace Jones: Bloodlight And Bami.",1
" Shot with an annoying lack of color, this is a less than compelling, but still moderately interesting, look at FBI agent Mark Felt aka DeepThroat, telling a Watergate story with no Bernstein and little Woodward.",1
" [A] great movie, and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema.",1
 Tim Burton takes his trademarks and destroys one of theater's great musicals.,0
" A drippy linking story only reinforces the concert video feel, and it inevitably lacks the spark of live performance.",0
 The fourth installment of Miller's Mad Max films is not to be missed. [full review in Spanish],1
 By the last half hour the film has descended into a procession of totally un-scary and mostly boring random images. ,0
" Thankfully, the strong performances make it easy to watch. I just wish the filmmakers had the conviction to make this into a truly great film. (Parental Review also Available)",1
" There is an extremely supportive and welcoming market for an actress like this in the right romantic comedy. Must Love Dogs is half that movie; witty, rueful, true and sweet. The other half is so conventionally dumb, it hurts.",0
" Storytelling has never been Burton's strong suit and his weakness is here compounded by a desire to somehow squeeze Carroll's topsy-turvy, logical-illogical tales into a teen-friendly, Disney-approved, big-screen adventure.",0
" Eschewing more sophisticated and higher-degree-of-difficulty moodiness for lots of panicked thrashing about, this found-footage horror tale is an exercise in well-intentioned tedium.",0
" Poorly written and with hardly any thrills, The Mule disappointingly depends on the amiability of Eastwood's character, whose extreme social ineptness is far beyond the redeeming powers of star power.",0
" If, on a fundamental level, the film's mix of tones doesn't always fully mesh, its many chases and other aerial moments at least provide a nice array of whiz-bang excitement.",1
 Three middle-class African-American men yearn to stay forever young as they struggle with their relationships with women.,1
" Funny, smart and sweet, with a great character at its centre, Night Of The Living Deb is a rom-zom-com that we can heartily recommend.",1
" ""Step Up Revolution"" is the series' ""Live Free or Die Hard"": There are more explosions and the stakes are laughably higher.",0
" With an intelligent, subtle script and camerawork so organically natural one doesn't immediately realize that each scene is shot in one take, the film draws on a subject much in the news and spins it into a multilayered yet low-key study...",1
" Several journalists perform keen off-the-cuff political analyses; several Austrian politicians bravely defy local orthodoxies; and free, frank hearings in the United States Congress add a painful element of nostalgia.",1
 Some movies go off on tangents. This movie is nothing but tangents.,0
 Aims low and hits the bull's-eye with enough firepower to sink the Bismarck.,0
" The film's low-key meandering almost recommends it, compared to more manic versions of this story. FUN MOM DINNER won't exhaust you, but it won't exhilarate you either.",0
" A noble shot at a novel barely worth reading, much less filming, and the fact that it comes as close as it does to really working is a minor miracle, and one worth seeing",1
 Funny in spats but overextending the Ch'ti concept to an ad nauseam degree ...,0
" The latest installment isn't quite as terrifying as the second, but it's still extremely creepy and engrossing and everything you'd want in a 21st-century nightmare maker.",1
" The Brave One might have been honest, perceptive, and troubling. Instead, it becomes aimless revenge porn.",0
" For at least a half hour, Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky is a brilliant and exciting film and seems almost sure to be one of the best of 2010.",1
" [Tobe Hooper] shows both his range and his thematic consistency in this luscious, morbid 1981 fairytale.",1
" Rosie's belated search for her father is affecting but in the end too familiar, and the film's insistence upon her preciousness grows tiring in light of the more devastating personal and political stories unfolding all around her.",0
" While watchable in a soapy way, TV level dialogue and script offer few surprises, and characters feel at the mercy of the next big bit of history Ducastel and Martineau have lined up.",0
" Call it forgiveness or codependency, but this highly personal film speaks to all of us in the universal languages of art and love.",1
" Inarritu, not content to just lay it on thick, smothers his canvas with self-important gloom.",0
" Ultimate X is a ride, basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine.",1
" Though not formally daring and fairly conventional in its storytelling, this is a quality picture which should appeal to arthouse audiences in festivals and elsewhere.",1
" A work of gentle, continual hilarity that feels far more ordinary than other Coen works and yet has every bit of the originality and exactness that makes the brothers' best films so wonderful.",1
" It's enormous fun, this film, and we owe Hartley a debt of gratitude.",1
" This minimalist thriller evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too under-dramatized to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort.",0
 It's a concept without a story.,0
" It's like Deep Impact as made by Michael Moore, and that's a good thing, or a good enough thing.",1
 Roll on Paradise: Faith and Paradise: Hope!,1
 An impressive calling card for director Caradog James rather than the finished article.,0
" The best way to watch Fast and Furious 8 is to wait for it to hit TV - tune in for the opening, disappear for an hour, and then return for the final third",0
 Romero's latest zombie movie ditches the subtext but retains the ability to frighten.,0
" It's an interesting concept, but the characters are thin and nothing here feels insightful.",0
 Get Hard is not only a bad movie but a profoundly wasted opportunity.,0
" a pale remake of ""Meet the Parents"" with an African American cast, and it's the cast that makes it tolerable.",0
" Despite the film's conventional comedic material, we're still rooted firmly in Coen Brothers territory.",1
" I appreciated the caressing style of the cinematography, fetishizing and sexualizing even the most inanimate and mundane recording equipment and sound-related props, but it's overall hollow and unsatisfying.",0
" One can see where the story might be of great interest to fans and devotees of Chanel, but for casual viewers who have never seen her as more than the face behind an empire, there's too little in this movie to provide more than a casual diversion.",0
" A movie that adheres to the Hollywood canons, impeccably shot and crafted and a strong presence by Blanchet and Mara. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
 This remake by Dennis Iliadis cost a great deal more than Craven's $100k and in many respects is an upgrade. What it lacks in the shock-of-the-new it makes up for with a more rounded storyline.,1
" A gripping, sophisticated, adrenaline-fuelled attempt at humanising today's folk devil, the banker ...",1
" Either as unintentional parody or truncated epic, you can start this Revolution without me.",0
 One long series of narrative gotchas masquerading as moral or intellectual sophistication before finally revealing that it offers nothing more than world-weary sentimentality.,0
" Desiree Akhavan's ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" is a laughable AND disturbing vision of life behind the lines of gay conversion therapy. ",1
 All interesting enough stuff set to some amazing images but it does become a little worthy and dull when it comes to celebrating Dr Patricia Wright and her efforts to ensure the survival of the species.,1
" Despite his innate intensity, Craig seems a bit... bored, maybe? Underutilized, despite appearing in nearly every frame of the film.",0
" American Hustle has its flaws, major and minor, but it's very entertaining and contains some great performances, especially by the female cast members.",1
" One of 2017's most unforeseen gems, this freewheeling bit of slasher craziness is an amusing genre miracle worth celebrating.",1
" I went in expecting that ""Accepted"" would flunk its PG-13 comedy course within minutes. Was I ever surprised to discover that it's sometimes clever, and surprisingly gentle -- a formula to be sure, yes, but an enjoyable one all the same.",1
" (A) cosmically overrated, emotionally vacant micro-drama...that unspools as a limp, cynical attempt to replicate the nuance-rich tapestry of her 2003 gem Lost in Translation.",0
" A creepy, moody, slow-paced film that adds no new angles to this well-worn legend.",0
 Has a wow factor unequalled by any Hindi film in memory.,1
" Depp's oddball acting fits heavenly with Burton's vision, and the two team up yet again for another rousing, wildly original collaboration.",1
" Sam Berns's charisma and hard-won grace are present throughout the documentary, which follows the now-17-year-old boy's two-year involvement in a clinical trial for a new treatment. ",1
" So the results are mixed in that Buster Scruggs is considered a feature film, and thus the anthology episodes should be taken individually rather than cohesively.",1
 Imagine The Sopranos made by NBC. Imagine Braveheart brought to you by The History Channel. Imagine Disney's South Park. That's what a PG-13 Elizabeth is like.,0
" The Adjustment Bureau is not a film to be taken seriously in any way, but it has an interesting idea at its heart...",1
" For Transformers fans, I suppose this is a dream motion picture. For everyone else, it's a nightmare.",0
 Sasha Lane's nuanced performance helps to make sense of Star's experience as they range between magical and the capitalist realities.,1

 Self-serving baloney reminiscent of Errol Morris's Robert McNamara documentary,0
 The other shame of Anton Corbijn's version of John le Carre's novel is that it's not much good.,0
" While Danny Boyle's frenetic direction excels, the film is always one long lost evil twin away from deteriorating to complete melodrama",0
" Its essential trashiness too often takes over. Rather than wondering about Rachel/Ellis' dilemma, you find yourself pondering Verhoeven's consistency in setting up bedroom shots so that there's always a nipple in the frame.",0
 Like watching someone channel-surf through five video game boss battles at the same time. ,0
" This true story plays like a gripping psychological thriller, offering hard speculation and harder truths. You won't be able to get it out of your head.",1
" Here's the newest entry in that curdled genre, the I-Hate-Christmas movie.",0
" Not the film America deserves, and it is also not the film America needs. But we got it anyway.",0
 The movie would have benefited from a more raucous and freewheeling application of its premise.,0
" Overall, for a film trying to cash in on internet culture, it's not half bad. It doesn't go for any moralizing statements about screen time or get on a soapbox about the potential dangers of it all.",1
 There's wonderful potential for permanently bleached out vistas to embody a metaphorical emptiness. Here it's just a great big blank.,0
" A fable about the merits of water conservation can make for dry viewing. Fortunately, Nila Madhab Panda goes down the well-trodden path of the rural satire in Kaun Kitney Paani Mein.",1
" The movie is about a surfer dude (sans comma), who is an analog dude trying to fit into a digital world, which is like trying to get a square peg into a Calabi-Yau Manifold, which is to say it probably won't work, and neither does this movie.",0
 A few scary moments don't make up for the maddeningly uneven and implausible tale.,0
" The special effects are remarkable, yet somehow numbing, and the film only partly lives up to the promise in the title of Lucas's company, Industrial Light and Magic.",0
" an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle, seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times, then found its sweet spot",1
 Babel is arresting thanks to the complexities of the storytelling and Inarritu's deft ability to massage the audience.,1
 Full-up with caricatures... fails in the most dire way to make any comments on the state of parenting and coupling in America rooted in actual observation.,0
" As the credits roll, the film's many flaws come sharply into focus. But while it lasts, Kung-Fu Panda is something of a guilty treat. ",1
" Prakash Jha aims for something trenchant about thwarted destiny and ugly ambition in modern Indian democracy but mostly winds up with a convoluted and tonally awkward Godfather rehash, with nary a character worth rooting for.",0
" My Cousin Rachel features terrific camera work from Mike Eley, and Michell certainly gets the tone and setting right. But the figures in the foreground seem to be competing against the cliffside scenery instead of occupying it.",0
" Despite stylish editing, lively performances and some effervescent dialogue, Skills Like This eventually becomes insipid, tedious, inane and a bit lackluster.",0
" There is much talk of paralysis in Robert Redford's what's-wrong-with-America movie Lions for Lambs, and there is a whole lot of the same in the movie itself.",0
" This isn't much more than a pleasant sports comedy and family drama hybrid, but it's surely entertaining. The very model of a summertime arthouse flick.",1
" A tale of revenge, aesthetically sublime and heartbreakingly violent. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" The plot twists are easily guessed, and the film goes on for one predicament too long, but there are some good laughs.",1
" Although there's much to like about The Cider House Rules, by the time the credits rolled the most enthusiastic reaction I could muster was little more than a shrug.",1
" Greengrass is a refined political artist, but United 93 goes pretty much entirely for gut reactions.",1
" It's part melodrama, part morality play and part thriller, more Dorian Gray than Bram Stoker and infused with a heady alchemic brew of ancient science, supernatural shadows, mutant organisms, demented villains... ",1
" Luckily, many of the plot's maudlin pitfalls are greatly mitigated by the film's utterly infectious leading lady.",1
" Who would think a fight over real estate would be so fascinating, so gut wrenching to watch?",1
" The story here, like a lot of bar bands, goes loud to cover up mediocrity. When Streep sings, though, so does the film.",0
 A senseless and forgettable second-rate horror film.,0
" A sincere, eerily lovely, and ultimately rather poetic horror-travelogue that transcends its considerable limitations. If the deliberately amorphous ending means what I think it does, bump it up another 10 points.",1
" ...unable to peddle their nonsense in the U.S., the evangelicals have found a ready target in Uganda, an English-speaking and primarily Christian country with a long history of evangelical missionary work...",1
" The first hour, which focuses on Mary and Percy's love story starts to sag, but when Mary finds her artistic inspiration, the film takes off.",1
" Jodie Foster has created an uneven, inordinately peculiar film, one that oscillates unsuccessfully between edgy black comedy and Hollywood convention.",0
" ...delightful, inventive, accessible, hilarious, and tremendously executed.",1
 Incredibly human and filled with a wisdom that only comes from great suffering.,1
" Having been locked up in Burton's toy chest for so long, [Bonham Carter] is all the more dazzling in this wistful two-character infidelity drama.",1
" Were William Castle still around and involved with this film, he would have had ice strewn all over theater floors and the AC cranked to 20 degrees. As it stands, Kormakur does enough via sight and sound to turn the Everest experience into one big chill.",1
 Pays real dividends with controversial themes and issues dealt with simply and subtly to provide a genuinely authentic insight into a mob experience that dare not speak its name.,1
" This isn't even really a sequel to the hilarious 2009 comedy smash set in Las Vegas. It's virtually the same movie, just transferred to another continent and with the raunch wildly amped up.",0
" It does nothing truly distinct from every other Marvel Studios offering, I will be first in line. If they think they can sucker me into paying for outdated special effects and a movie I have seen many times over, they have another thing coming.",0
" With a romantic lyricism that never dips into sentimentality, he (Loach) has captured the poetry of populism that has always driven his work.",1
 The film captures the alienated state of homelessness so completely that by the end the average citizens strolling by seem foreign.,1
" A hatefully paint-by-numbers story of pretty young people on vacation flirting, bickering, and dying, with far too little of the third and far too much of the first.",0
 One wonders if Zemeckis knows what kind of story he is telling. [Full review in Spanish],0
" It is fun enough, but it lacks the richness and complexity of McDonagh's earlier work. It also lacks a conspirator like Gleeson, whose spirit, heart and substance is missing here.",0
" Most of the film is good enough that way: dumb, but not boring.",0
 Wild Grass is the vision of Alain Resnais. He suggests that anything can happen in movies. Or in our imaginations.,1
 There's only one way The Prince and Me could be any worse - it could have starred Kate Hudson.,0
" In ""Suburbicon,"" none of it comes together and, in the end, it feels like Clooney is doing his best Coen Brothers impression instead of making this movie his own.",0
" A sympathetic but clear-eyed character study transforms into something more insidious, sobering and infuriating in ""(T)error,"" a superb documentary that personalizes the U.S. War on Terror in ways that make the human toll intimate and unmistakable.",1
" We Bought a Zoo drops the cynicism, wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn't mind laying it on thick in an effort to move you. Which it does-whether you like it or not. ",1
" The Grandmaster works best if you've never seen a kung fu movie before. If you have, Wong Kar Wai's film may strike you as a beautiful and expensive missed opportunity. ",0
" Elle suffers from too many subplots, and runs on 15 minutes too long. But the work is a real showcase for Huppert, who at 63 is wiry, intense and utterly compelling.",1
" Endlessly referential, with nonstop spy-movie action and refresher-course Euro-culture intentions, Krstic's artsy caper pic is clearly a highbrow labor of love.",1
" After a slow start, it has just enough Disney charm to entertain the children (of course) as well as the parents.",1
" Austenland is a pretty film to look at, but underneath its look, there's just not much there.",0
" It doesn't help that, in the title role, Marc Anthony has all the onscreen charisma of wet dough.",0
" Schwentke's romantic melodrama obeys no dramatic rules or narrative logic, desperately striving for the erotic appeal of The Notebook and the supernatural mystery of Ghost, which Oscar-winning scribe Rubin also penned.",0
" Pixar's brand can withstand some damage, but there's no denying that a cornball time-burner of a sequel like Cars 3 counts as a big loss.",0
" In the hands of Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell and a strong supporting cast, this earnest film manages to tug a few heartstrings and say something important in the process.",1
 [An] involving and unexpectedly passionate film ...,1
 [T]he screenplay runs around in circles ...,0
" Too soon, the toys, gadgets and stunts for which the franchise has become famous reclaim it, and Die Another Day becomes indistinguishable from the other faceless action films that seek that same audience.",0
" The International, a sleek travelogue thriller, at least flirts with timeliness, winking at an angry and anxious public mood.",0
 There is a richness of character here that belies the film's trim eighty-six minute running time.,1
" It's a bit long, and one side of its two-part narrative doesn't work quite as well as the other, but it's a strong and surprising piece of work.",1
 It may seem like a soft-centred romp but there is often more to Their Finest than meets the eye.,1
 ...feels made for an audience of one; a fact that Godard and his dedicated legion of fans will surely see as of little to no concern...,0
" The Dark Knight Rises not only ends on a perfect note but it also, as a whole, rounds off the trilogy beautifully.",1
" This narrative splice job simply doesn't hold together. Call it a taut mess or a hot mess, take your pick.",0
" Beautifully photographed and well acted but the storyline, especially when Kingsley's character takes center stage, is tediously tiring",0
" Sometimes a concept that works well in a novel just seems silly when translated to the big screen, and Dreamcatcher is burdened with more than its fair share of silliness.",0
" Tverdovsky doesn't take the story anywhere really startling. His compassionate, intriguing film is enjoyable but anticlimactic.",1
" This fourth installment in the franchise delivers when it comes to kick-butt, action-packed mayhem but bogs down focusing on key characters staring at computer screens, typing madly on keyboards or spouting techno-babble.",0
" Emma Stone delivers a star-making performance here, but memorable scenes with veteran actors Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson make the film something special. ",1
" The combination of innocence and steely determination make Jack a sympathetic figure and the film delivers enough tough, tender insight into his life to strike a universal chord.",1
" Even if you don't care for the band, Kijak's exuberant style which mirrors the music might win you over.",1
" There's a touch of Gracie Allen in Frances, an indomitable blithe spirit who lives happily within a bubble-world of her own construction.",1
 'Black Butterfly' offers thrills and nerve-wracking excitement as well as strong performances by its excellent co-stars.,1
" If you enjoy cinematic outrageousness for its own sake, you may have a good time with Tomie: Unlimited; unfortunately, the film's real strength is buried beneath the special effects.",0
" A kind of raunchy coming-of-age movie about grownups, 'Neighbors' touches upon responsibility and the very definition of being an adult.",1
" Stalingrad is a battle, all right. But it's one that the audience loses.",0
 The history is fascinating enough to overcome the film's intrusive digital transitions.,1
 It's trapped by its own gentle insouciance.,0
" With facts that are stranger than fiction and a story surrounding a murder that is often played as dark comedy, Bernie exists somewhere between an Errol Morris documentary and Fargo.",1
" ""Run All Night"" is a mostly satisfying action-drama from director Jaume Collet-Serra, who made Neeson's ""Non-Stop"" such a guilty pleasure.",1
 ...offers more pleasure as a jigsaw puzzle than it does as a movie. ,0
 This is still a wonderful portrait of a man who chose to embrace life to its fullest whilst biting his thumb at gravity.,1
" While it clearly moves at a slower pace than most modern films, it is still one of the most beautiful and atmospheric horror pictures ever made.",1
 It's nonetheless immensely satisfying - not least in its commitment to a child protagonist whose near-feral intensity and unthinking ingratitude make him the polar opposite of cute.,1
" There are, inevitably, a couple of riveting moments mixed in with the agitprop.",1
" Well-acted, beautifully shot and splendidly costumed, it's superior to the original in its looks, but not as potent or meaningful in its story line.",0
 I would have liked an emotional anchor to keep me invested for the entirety of the proceedings.,0
" Out of Sight isn't just a rousing piece of entertainment, it's also a cinematic salvage operation.",1
" The movie equivalent of a mean girls' game whose only goal is the humiliation of its protagonist, for your entertainment. Also: a failed parable of the twistedness of the 1 percent.",0
" The snail's-pace horizontal pans, under-the-flight-path score, and other arthouse affectations had collided with the overall unlikeability of the major characters violently enough to make me consider jumping ship. ",0
 Concepts appear and are abandoned with ruthless efficiency; threats rise and are dispatched with the glum drudgery of a janitor cleaning up puke in the toilet.,0
 There is all this talent -- and so little reason for it in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.,0
" It does not make for appealing, let alone sympathetic, heroes.",0
" By erasing all the mystery from Lecter's past, Harris and director Webber have also stripped him of his ability to terrify, and their film, though gory and violent enough, is almost entirely devoid of shock or suspense.",0
" Miller gives a go-for-broke performance as the increasingly desperate and undone Sedgwick. But she lacks the fragile charisma evident in even the coarsest Warhol films, and without it there's no reason to care.",0
 What I mostly liked was the warmth between the two leads.,1
 Affecting performances and fully realized characters.,1
 The second absolutely atrocious remake in 2005 of a John Carpenter movie...And where's Tom Atkins when you need him?,0
" The actors, unquestionably and predictably, are leagues better than the material deserves.",0
" What is that message? Acceptance trumps bitter resentment; love beats lonely isolation. Some may call this simplistic, but in Masaya's world even a sliver of light or glimpse of a face are precious. And basics matter more.",1
" It's weird and brilliant to say that a Black Panther film is properly a good film, able to stand on its own and add to the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Top marks.",1
" The result, for all its swirly colors and surrealism, is alternately dull and irritating, an experience akin to learning that you're going on a field trip only to discover that it's to the box factory.",0
" It's a shame Redford might be retiring, but what a fitting note to go out on.",1
" It doesn't quite work, but there's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos' next offering.",0
" What started out as cheeky fun ripens into black humor, and then overripens into an oppressive gilding of the lilles that stink.",0
" Fun enough thanks to some last minute spectacle and Johnson, but not everything need be so serious. It could have been so much more.",1
" Juno isn't a film made in the bell jar of unlikely reality that is, far too often, Hollywood: It's a film whose attention to real-life detail is so fine, audiences will be hopelessly and happily lost in its story from the first frame.",1
" Now I have no attachment to the original cartoon but for anyone who did like it, this can't be what you wanted. ",0
" Scary Mother proves delightfully off-kilter, the dead seriousness of the social setting and the family conflict pierced by humorous or absurdist moments.",1
 very ordinary screenplay that can only be recommended due to the outstanding performances of its combatants,1
" Taken as a whole, if you allow yourself to take a leap of faith The Adjustment Bureau is an intriguing, engrossing experience. At the very least, it just might be the perfect date movie.",1
" Not quite as clever as it thinks it is, but still oozing more dark wit than most teen movies can dream of.",1
 Viewers with patience will be rewarded by a story of survival that builds toward inevitable tragedy.,1
" While all the young actors are committed to their characters (though none of them particularly stand out), this film will likely drown in its own nothingness as far more thought-provoking teenage fare continues to prevail.",0
" Endlessly inventive and wildly funny, Shaun the Sheep Movie has the frenetic pacing of some silent comedy classic.",1
 White Boy Rick exudes empathy for its titular character and his situation. ,1
" It's superficial, manipulative and schmaltzy.",0
 This is most certainly not as good as it gets.,0
 It's a celebration of brazen nonconformity centered on an insufferable flibbertigibbet who makes the worst case for nonconformity imaginable.,0
" The Diary of a Teenage Girl is undeniably bold in its candor, but it leaves us feeling empty.",0
 It's too bad-Cooties has promise as a premise but the end result is just a mess.,0
" ""The Woman"" is an affront to human decency that no self-respecting critic (even this tolerant horror fan) would enthusiastically endorse.",0
" Latifah has talent and personality to spare, so it would be great to see her taking on more romantic roles. But to sell herself short in the process? Clearly, even she knows that's just wrong.",1
 Sometimes real life provides us with symbolic imagery that is every bit as potent and sophisticated as anything you would find in a fictional narrative.,1
" With only the most minimal of inspection, it's clear that J.H. Wyman's screenplay is a convoluted mess...",0
" ...rife with soap-opera simplicities, yet Ferrera's plucky smile and Tamblyn's sardonic sneer manage to redeem them.",1
" The movie has physical honesty, and reaches for emotional honesty, too.",1
" Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated and doesn't reach its full potential.",0
" Rapturous cinema of the senses...proves once again that nobody does swoony romantic longing, and heartache, like Wong Kar-Wai.",1
 Helena Bonham Carter is great dotty fun as Fairy Godmother.,1
" With Witherspoon's charisma and the infectious efforts of a supporting cast, it's hard not to like this trifling little stroll down memory lane - but not impossible.",0
 Harlin amps up the sound effects and gore in an attempt to disguise the absence of any genuine scares.,0
" A sunny, charming apocalypse film that overcomes its contrived premise. Even the off-beat pairing of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley works better than you'd imagine. ",1
" Margot oozes poison from start to finish, challenging you to give a damn.",1
" The result is pure pumpkin, though fans of squeaky-clean, helium-voiced Hilary Duff might fall under its sickly sweet spell.",0
" Tom of Finland briefly moves to California when Laaksonen's fortunes begin to rise in the '70s, but it becomes a weak-tea Boogie Nights along the way.",0
" Simply put, a hugely enjoyable mockumentary that will get a smile out of the most coldest of hearts.",1
 A train wreck romcom.,0
