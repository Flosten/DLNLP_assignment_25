Review,Freshness
 Pirate Radio is going to be the event of the year for guys of indeterminate age (but closer to fifty than to fifteen) who can never get enough Sixties rock 'n' roll at the movies.,1
" Does nothing for anyone who isn't cheering for the cameos of Amy Jo Johnson and Jason David Frank and the one utterance of ""Ay-yi-yi!"" by Alpha 5.",0
" It's kind of a thriller, but any genre expectations will be thwarted by writer/director J.C. Chandor's almost-perverse pleasure in stopping shy of the boiling point. A Most Violent Year is all about the simmer.",1
" It's a crackerjack premise, if only because it fundamentally alters the fabric of the traditional horror template.",1
" For a movie seemingly concerned with clarity and enlightenment, it's woefully lacking in both.",0
" Even though August Rush is sappy, it's the kind of sweetness that everyone needs once in awhile -- like a big, honkin' ice cream sundae.",1
" A chintzy, poorly acted origin story of the legendary Greek hero that blatantly mimics its genre ancestors while drenching its action in corny 3D and CG-enhanced slow-motion.",0
" Unfortunately, the film raises more questions than it answers.",0
" There are moments when it seems Kutcher might look right into the camera and say, 'Ready to see me walk right into another impossibly stupid faux pas?'",0
 The opening-credit montage featuring real-life news bloopers is funnier than anything in the script.,0
" Beautifully shot and willing to grapple with morality in ways both serious and playful Thirst entertains without moralizing, though it frequently lacks narrative drive.",1
" Beautifully acted, intellectually engaging, and dramatically satisfying, Mud deserves to rocket to the top of your must-see list. ",1
" If 8mm and Cloverfield mated, they might produce Chronicle.",0
 It's one picturesque disaster after another.,0
" Baywatch won't blow anything out of the water (except for the boat it sets on fire), but it will certainly make a splash.",1
" Poor pacing ensures that most of the chuckles come in the film's second half, which makes the first half a chore.",0
" The film's late, unprepared-for perversity turnabout undoes what has gone before.",0
" Deliciously acted and good-humored to its core, it's one of the summer's very best surprises.",1
" 42 is a hackneyed, cookie-cutter film that manages to tell us absolutely nothing about a turning point in American history.",0
" [Charlize] Theron strides like a woman born to break both hearts and necks. [James] McAvoy and agency bosses John Goodman and Toby Jones provide amusing backup, but Theron lights the fire that keeps Atomic Blonde burning.",1
" The story isn't bad and it has a good message, but the pacing drains all of the energy and fun out of what could have been an exceptional family movie.",0
" If the shift in tone is jarring, the climax of the film is confusing and self-involved, and it makes for an underwhelming experience all around.",0
" Guy Maddin docu about his hometown gives fans everything they'd expect, plus a few moments of unexpected sincerity.",1
" Forget all the ruinously expensive special effects. They're not worth a minute of your time, much less two hours of mind-boggling mediocrity.",0
" An irresistible charmbomb. The in-jokes are verbal and visual, managing to reference themes as diverse as immigration and insider trading. It's all very droll and quietly, memorably dazzling. ",1
" Might keep the youngest of kiddos hypnotized by the gaudy imagery on screen, but Hop is far from hip.",0
" Color me relieved. There is no need to fear death, even the most horrifying kind of murder. Because the afterlife is exactly like the album cover for a 1970s progressive-rock band.",0
" The escalation of greed is a major factor in the film, and the unsettling aspiration of always wanting more - the ugly side of the American Dream - is rife.",1
" Appears to believe it has something poignant and universal to say about love and sex, but it hits not one plausible or emotionally authentic note.",0
" The message is nearly as slight as the presentation and just as hard to pin down, but even when tackling something as sharp edged and soft bellied as exclusion Littlerock is not without its pleasures.",1
" ""Edge"" is the operative word, as Craig grinds the genre's conventions to a razor sharpness that cut deep and give Steinfeld a platform to tap all her best instincts in fleshing out the most loveable narcissistic cynic since Larry David.",1
 It's exactly the kind of film that I'll forget having ever seen by the time Summer is over and that's too bad as I do love the premise of the film and I'm a fan of Rainn Wilson.,0
" As seen through Lord's eyes, the dramas and passions on display throughout the film come off as melodramas and grotesqueries.",0
" The co-directors and co-writers, Jay and Mark Duplass, appear to be saying, 'Hey, we are the new emperors of the independent cinema. And guess what? We have no clothes.'",0
" Neveldine and Taylor simply spray their venom across the screen with little vision, once again making a friendly trip to the multiplex feel like undeserved torture.",0
" I wish the film version of Astro Boy provided a stronger antidote to mediocrity....the script takes its sweet time establishing its rules and locale, then rolls in one too many subplots.",0
 The sinking realization kicks in: These people are taking this nonsense seriously.,0
" Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines tells the simple yet compelling story of a very old piece of equipment that refuses to go away. Its name is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and, as famously promised, he's back, and at his anticharismatic best, too.",1
 James Gray's long but very entertaining film reminds us of the derring-do that once drove Britons to overrun the globe.,1
" Never lives up to - or, for that matter, does anything to deserve - the recent parody tribute offered by Michael Bolton in a ""Saturday Night Live"" digital short...",0
" Skynet, Schmynet -- the future is here.",1
 Why is it that uplifting movies based on true stories often feel so untrue and fall so flat?,0
 Let the dust finally settle on these museum pieces.,0
 Even Boston Red Sox fans are likely to turn away in disgust.,0
" The year's most pleasant cinematic surprise. Once has enough heart, wit, verve and sheer songwriting genius to ensure you'll see it far more times than its title suggests.",1
 Adam Sandler takes on terrorism as Israeli agent-turned-hair stylist in raunchy shock comedy.,0
" Well, at least you can't accuse them of deceptive advertising: this grossed-out action comedy is, indeed, a cop out - in every sense of the word.",0
 A star is born in Storm Reid.,1
 Moving doc about troubled teens has powerful themes. ,1
 At least this feels like a Cameron Crowe movie.,1
" Granted, there may be some problematic road traversed in regards to mental health issues and power dynamics, but the talent involved is too great to deny Aardvark at least one viewing. ",1
" An artist-playboy stalking an ex-girlfriend sounds tailor-made for Charlie Sheen, but he and his comedy are rather bland. A not quite fully formed film from Roman Coppola.",0
 An instant classic amongst supernatural thrillers with a finely crafted surprise ending and a hot Nicole Kidman to boot.,1
" An electrifying and poignant double biography of two west coast bands...a sort of rock equivalent of 'Hoop Dreams,' substituting music for basketball.",1
" The whole film is shot in compellingly austere colors and a rapt gaze sweeping downward from the sky and ending, horrifyingly fixed on armored bodies lying in the mud. ",1
 A profound testament to the extraordinary power of moving images and sound.,1
" Shot over two years ago, released on the least-attended movie weekend of the year, and withheld from press screenings. Yowsa...one goofy thriller that can barely sustain a running time, much less provide heart-stopping chills.",0
" A funny, if farfetched, revenge fantasy for folks bilked by the likes of Bernie Madoff.",1
" [W]ants to have its pseudoscience cake and eat it too... The entire endeavor is laughable and ludicrous, a victim of its own misplaced earnestness.",0
 A warmly romantic comedy and a wonderful Christmas gift for viewers from The Joy Luck Club's Wayne Wang,1
 There's just enough here. Or almost enough. ,0
" So many heartbreaking performances in American cinema give us hysterya, suffering, weeping and sobing, just so we can feel pain. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" If You Don't Mess With the Zohan isn't the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations, it's at least the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations featuring a former Mossad agent who shags Lainie Kazan.",1
" A romantic comedy with zombies that has only sputtering comedy that is mostly undersold by its cast, and zombies that never entirely make sense or feel like a credible threat.",0
" Slowing the pace for romance is also a bad idea because it gives the audience the chance to spot plot holes bigger than Iceland's debt. But when he sticks to car chases, explosions and chest-kicking action, Statham delivers.",1
" The true merit of the movie is the momentary pleasures of the dialogue and the performances, but the story itself leaves you wanting. So, is it art? Looks like it.",0
" Cuesta has succeeded in making a clear and captivating narrative involving the issues of trust, loss and deceit, all of which take place within the space of a week.",1
" so many of the characters are so soulless, making it difficult to see past their sarcastic, brash exteriors... So when all the iciness melts away, the sentimentality which replaces it seems unconvincingly pat.",0
" There's not much in Skiptrace you haven't seen before, and Harlin seems to realize this, infusing the film with a generally carefree attitude toward even the most dramatic and/or emotional of situations.",0
 An overblown home movie with almost no dialogue.,0
" The coincidences might be too much for some, but viewers who can get past them will be treated to a suspenseful, well-acted, crisply photographed character study.",1
" Haraamkhor's characters are supposed to have shades of grey, but their blandness can never be mistaken for maturity. About the most shocking thing about this major-minor affair is its sloppiness.",0
 ... a new missed opportunity to regain the respect of critics and the public. [Full review in Spanish],0
" This Left Behind may be worse than the last Left Behind, but it's much less boring, thanks in part to the commitment of its star, who plays the often ludicrous material with the straightest of faces. The Cage works in mysterious ways.",0
" Better than the first film, but still too long and drawn out. ",1
" Middlingly racist, humorless, and downright inept, Pearl Harbor is solely for fans of fireworks factories.",0
 As deeply entertaining and creative as it is socially enlightening.,1

 It's a delight to see Deneuve and Frot share scenes. [Full Review in Spanish] ,1
 Neil Jordan's first feature film in six years is a derivative and at times ludicrous psychodrama.,0
 This isn't funny. It's sad and disheartening and demeaning...,0
 'The simplicity of the tale on the surface belies the depth of feeling that comes roaring out from behind Eastwood's enduring squint.',1
" Eye-popping and bounding with energy, this is fun for audiences of all ages.",1
" ""Gun"" acknowledges the solutions to this ongoing problem are neither easy nor obvious, while persuasively arguing that more, surely, can be done.",1
" Director Kevin Allen offers a lot more gadgets in Cody 2, but surprisingly little in the way of memorable action.",0
 Go see Awake fully-caffeinated with a bunch of friends willing to yell back at the screen and cheer for Lena Olin whenever she appears. It's the right way to enjoy such an unintentionally camp piece of crap.,0
" Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's ""Mister Blue Sky"" can't be all bad, but the ""Guardians"" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out.",1
" Even at less than 80 minutes sans end credits, ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is about as pleasant as elephant semen to the face.",0
" ""Truth or Dare"" is a weak b-movie, that has been punched up by Blum's producer credit and the popular cast. It's certainly not a good film. And, hopefully, it is not a sign of things to come from the Blumhouse team.",0
 The only real suspense in Basic Instinct 2 is whether Stone will or won't reprise the scene that she once absurdly claimed she was tricked into doing.,0
" In purely cinematic terms, Buried, set in late 2006, is an ingenious exercise in sustained tension that would make Alfred Hitchcock turn over in his grave.",1
" ...clumsy, unfunny, disgracefully sexist.",0
" There's not much drama and even less tension to Skate Kitchen, but that's just fine; the movie glides along with the characters as they drift through their days.",1
" Surprising, intoxicating, euphoric and will undoubtedly be the greatest jazz drumming movie you see all year.",1
" A clear-sighted, compassionate portrait of a troubled soul.",1
" Dig Two Graves makes some pretty nifty transitions from the 1940s to the 1970s, including one seemingly unbroken shot. Every trip to the past reveals something about the ""present-day"" journey.",1
" This clever Finnish export is not for any child who cannot be exposed to R-rated language, scary Santas and plenty of gore. ""Rare Exports"" has the potential for ""Bad Santa"" style cult status.",1
" Nothing more than an attempt to stroke the ""Star Wars"" fans ... they're probably the only ones who might appreciate what is generally a weak and unfunny movie.",0
 Although Whiteley's unrestricted there-ness effortlessly yields an avuncular striver ... it means little when the viewpoint is so hermetic.,0
 Refn's style is worth sampling even though it feels in search of a subject.,1
" If you're old enough to read this, odds are the first thing you want to know about ""Open Season"" is: ""How much is this going to annoy me?""",0
 Everything about Impostor ... is both familiar and profoundly unoriginal.,0
 Does a terrific job of showing the competitive nature of not just the kids but their parents and the pressure put on teenagers to perform...,1
" The script is episodic by nature as it blurs fantasy and reality, with some vignettes more amusing or compelling than others.",0
" Someone would have to be pretty soft to buy the whole thing, and awfully hard not to fall at all.",1
" While it seems like grand slam material for the bearded maestro, the story rarely gets off the ground, lost between its dreamy storybook qualities and need to reinforce the bone-chilling tragedy of war. ",0
 It must be the end of the world: the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes.,1
" Although you may have to sit through some melodramatic moments and you know ultimately how Seabiscuit turns out, don't worry. Sit back, learn a little history and enjoy a great ride.",1
" Exactly the movie that one expects it to be -- a frustrating quality for some, but smooth medicine for those who trust and like writer-actors' puppy dog tales that unfold loosely in the vein of Ed Burns.",1
 A mediocre production that nevertheless will strike a deep and resonant chord with viewers.,0
" Coster-Waldau gives a committed performance, but Waugh's screenplay and direction is so focused on the machinations of crime that it ignores the gang's structural contradictions, and any hint of desire or sexual necessity.",0
 A surreal descent into a twilight zone created by the twisted sensibilities of two cinematic geniuses.,1
 Qureshi and Saleem can do little with the limited material and unimaginative direction.,0
 Annemarie Jacir's characters may not leave the city of Nazareth as they take a circular road trip in Wajib but the emotional distance they travel is considerable.,1
" Rather than employ Harmonium's setup for humorous or bittersweet insights, Fukada distills the conceit into his most harrowing, tragic parable to date.",1
" Room demands not just to be seen, but felt-and the feelings echo long after you've left the theater. This is destined to be one of the year's best and most celebrated films.",1
" I get the whole loud kitschy 80s-tribute vibe, but there is a thin line between imitation and impersonation.",0
 A movie that renews our faith in the pertinence and durability of this 50-year-old franchise.,1
 Moonlight takes the concept of the bildungsroman to its natural end point in ways that many coming-of-age stories don't.,1
" It's a comic shift some hardcore action fans may not like, but, honestly, you probably shouldn't have been taking this stuff so seriously in the first place.",0
 The Lunchbox offers us a naturalistic glimpse of middle-class life in modern Mumbai.,1
" Perhaps, like me, you find the oeuvre of British writer-director Richard Curtis a bit -- how shall I put it -- twee?",0
" 'Trust me, when you walk out of the theater from this one, you'll know you've seen a great movie.'",1
 A get-under-your-skin makes no sense classic with some of the scariest images ever put on film.,1
" Murray's spot-on portrayal of a man juggling myriad pressures and demands, from petty to momentous, marks one of the film's greatest strengths.",1
" This forgettable sci-fi fantasy is a sullen, superficial slog.",0
" Although not worse than the prequels for me, The Last Jedi is its own special kind of meh that demonstrates Disney doesn't have the guts to do this franchise any justice. ",0
" Even before a ""do as I say, not as I do"" twist costs it all credibility, ""Prescription Thugs"" is a not very good documentary about a very important subject.",0
 Not funny and very predictable.,0
" Endless rounds of boisterous battle scenes and eardrum annihilating explosions, until you couldn't care less which side wins. So if there's any real human passion rising to the surface amid the rubble, it's all about the guns, baby.",0
 The sole pleasure I got was in gazing at the fancy costumes and taking in the lush grounds of the snobby Lady Gresham's estate.,0
" It's an exciting watch, but more than that it's a respectful appreciation of Hong Kong cinema and all those who came before.",1
" ""Widows"" is a gritty heist movie and a story of female empowerment.",1
" Move over Bollywood, because India is going indie.",1
" Tony Gilroy's Michael Clayton feels so fresh, so smart, so different from the standard-issue legal thriller that it isn't until nearly an hour in that you notice how conventional a movie it actually is.",1
" The story of Billy Elliot is as old as the coal buried in England's hills, and it's as new as the voyage of self-discovery that some teen-ager somewhere has to make every day.",1
" It plays out as lame as you might think with the dude version being Sandler in ""angry"" mode and the sister nothing more than a collection of obnoxious traits.",0
" Sadly, there are no brilliantly stupid scenes",0
 I daresay that even a splinter in the eyeball would be less painful than sitting through this debacle.,0
" While Helen Mirren elevates the material with her usual aplomb and the events being depicted inevitably are stirring, this is a stodgy crusade-for-justice drama, directed and written with minimal flair.",0
" It's a deeply assured piece of direction, and though it only plays a few emotional notes, they are ones that won't soon leave your memory.",1
" ""Tomorrowland"" soars with such giddy, gee-whiz spirit that it almost feels rude to point out that, eventually, it resigns itself to being merely a competent action-adventure spectacle.",1
" Good luck understanding how any of this might appeal to modern moviegoers. It isn't awful, but it's needlessly convoluted and dull, dull, dull.",0
" The Island is this year's I, Robot.",0
" ""Final Girls"" eventually loses its way, but the epilogue is funny ... and the blooper reel is worth sticking around for.",0
 Jack Reacher may be cinema's reigning street-fighting ascetic.,1
 Coppola seems to have no interest in exploring the emotional consequences of the rivalries.,0
" I have no idea why, whenever a studio decides to do a big musical, they never actually hire singers to act in the films",0
" A blandly diverting, chastely conceived and grammatically challenged fairy tale for our bland, chaste and grammatically challenged age.",0
" There's nothing really new in this lengthy 1995 thriller by writer-director Michael Mann about cops and robbers in Los Angeles, but it has craft, pacing, and an overall sense of proportion, three pretty rare classic virtues nowadays.",1
" It's intermittently fun, and funny, but after a while it's just so much swinging back and forth. We get it. You're up. You're down. You're back up again.",0
" Although the question of why God allows bad things to happen is sometimes handled clumsily, it is approached sincerely, and it clearly points to the difference faith can make.",1
" ScarJo breaks a lot of real and synthetic bones, but the movie doesn't break any new ground.",0
" Carol uses satire as a mask which, once cast aside, leads to ... unspoken discussions on station, gender, sexuality, and identity.",1
 A monument to cinematic suckiness.,0
" ""Willow Creek"" is a defiant slow burn.",1
" It may not have won the Oscar, but this is ... an ambitious and thrilling work. ",1
" In terms of enjoying it on the basis of pure showmanship, it's perhaps the most effective musical transition to the big screen since this current movie musical mini-revival began.",1
" Through small gestures and bold choices, [Gosling's] created a character you begin feeling sorry for and end up rooting for and almost envying, simply because he's found something (someone?) that makes him feel whole and alive.",1
" The atmosphere is appropriately creepy, and there are some starts, if not outright scares. But it just gets stupid.",0
 Pirates of the Caribbean is fun -- but only as long as you don't expect much.,1
" The situation delivers less wackiness than it promises, and there aren't a lot of big laughs. Charm fills the void, though.",1
 It's an uphill battle for Jack and Jill with this leaky pail of comic swill.,0
" The movie, which for two hours is an absorbing, detailed procedural, becomes... willfully diffuse in its final 20 minutes.",0
 The film flatlines the moment anyone draws a blade.,0
" Washington's quirky performance shines brightly, but in a movie that otherwise doesn't present an especially strong case for rushing out to see it.",1
 Star-power overcomes staginess in this surprisingly warm romance.,1
 The documentary Darfur Now proves that -- no matter how important the subject matter -- following various people around with a camera doesn't necessarily make a film.,0
 Fassbinder could take on any style and make it his own. ,1

 This is a beautifully touching tale that has a lot of say about celebrating the past and why me must remember those who have come before us.,1
 Creative Control is the bleeding-edge tech drama we hoped Steve Jobs would be. It's always the start-ups that surprise us.,1
" Often feels like a bootleg version of Mike Leigh's Vera Drake, with the same conflicted female central character who eventually pays for her sins.",0
 ... can be read both as a literal illustration of the story of Christ's suffering at the hands of the Roman... and an anti-authoritarian tract that questions the very assumptions of guilt and blame that many take for granted the film shares.,1
" Director David Slade is clearly of the opinion that more is more, so there is lots of blood, lots of gore, and lots of vampires in black coats standing around as if auditioning for a remake of the Michael Jackson Thriller video.",0
" one of those blessed pictures in which all elements, from its writing through to its editing, coalesce into a work of profound philosophical and emotional unity",1
" Chances are you'll be too giddy to think about anything other than a second helping. Tarantulas on a Train? Scorpions on a Sailboat perhaps? Fear not, the internet is already abuzz.",1
" A bad movie and a frequently unwatchable one, but for the first time in years Sandler and co-writer Tim Herlihy have bothered to write real, actual jokes.",0
" Eight-year-old me probably would have found SpongeBob's antics vastly more entertaining, but alas, I now need my seagull poop jokes coupled with something more substantial.",0
" The best of Hostiles is powerful and memorable, its strengths amplified by Masanobu Takayanagi's haunting cinematography and Max Richter's score.",1
" A totally different beast: darker, riskier, and more brutal. [Full review in Spanish]",1

" In THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, relatively standard mad scientist horror film elements combine with a truly twisted premise.",0

 The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility.,0
" By pushing an easy answer and ignoring the complexities of desire, the filmmakers don't speak authentically to a contemporary youth audience, no matter how much lip gloss they put on their heroine.",0
" Fallout... isn't the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird's Ghost Protocol), but it's easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it's nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!",1
" Diablo Cody has written a script in which the characters themselves are well-drawn, but there isn't enough time or space on the page to devote fully to each drama that is presented.",0
" The film ramps up its safe premise with relentless entertainment that deserves some kind of late-night secret screening, bravely packing a punch without ever losing any sartorial flair. ",1

 The time is right for Milk.,1
" No great shakes, but a decent reputation-saver from Hirschbiegel.",1
" In this polemical drama, a military contractor who works from the safety of his home office is confronted by the brutal reality of what he does for a living.",0
" The slow-burn build-up to a final showdown is, of course, a standard Western narrative device, but director Gavin O'Connor repeatedly defuses tension by cutting away to convoluted flashbacks revealing the characters' emotionally tangled backstories.",0
" Like Spider-Man 3, Shrek the Third is an experiment in excess.",0
" In Bruce McDonald's suitably weird zombie movie, the coin of the shock jock's own realm -- language -- is the source of all the trouble.",1
" The flat-lining, alien-abduction thriller The Fourth Kind offers a close encounter that buries an interesting idea under a barrage of gimmicky, carnivallike hokum.",0
" Until the potent concluding scene, the humor and shallow profundities of We Have a Pope pivot on the cuteness of geriatrics, especially when they're spiking a volleyball in slo-mo.",0
" 21 is a mini-Ocean's Eleven about, and for, people who are the age of its title.",0
" The utter realness of this story and the way it has been handled is the resonating strength of Jamal Joseph's gripping, affecting study of survival in today's Harlem.",1
 Horn dives into one of the most complex character's I've seen created for a child and shakes loose.,1
 Rough and tumble violence in an uncaring world.,1
 Davies fans will be used to his unique style but his slow-motion narrative could have unfamiliar pundits bewailing the fact the Battle of Britain went the other way.,1
" What emerges is a fascinating and illuminating story, one that runs the gamut from intense joy to deep sadness and features a couple of surprising twists that take proceedings off in strange and unusual directions.",1
" Fred Claus turns out to be not bad for a Santa movie, which I suppose could be interpreted as either faint or excessive praise, depending on your view.",1
" A film starring two A-list comediennes should, at the very least, be funny. Snatched fails on this count but also seems to have other ambitions. A talented cast and crew just can't make this film come together, and that's a real shame",0
" How come filmmakers 50 years ago could do sentiment without going all sappy, and we can't do that now?",1
" Promoted as a prequel to Twin Peaks, but it was actually Excalibur pushed through the heart of a phenomenon, leaving the faithful to grieve, while newcomers were left baffled, or in my case, ravenous for more.",1
" Albert gets offered the opportunity to redeem her actions, and make light of why and how she conned the world. Unsurprisingly, she's a hell of a storyteller.",1

" Even in a chilly movie like this, deaths have resonance (whether they're on camera, or off).",1
 The Incredibles promotes a new moral slogan for our times: The family that fights evil-doers together stays together.,0
" At least give That's My Boy credit for fully earning its R rating. The film represents the horny, stoned, drunk id lurking behind the freshly scrubbed shenanigans of the Happy Madison brand.",0
" Compared to director Wes Craven's previous horror outing, last year's unforgivably awful My Soul to Take, Scream 4 is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.",1
 The best way to enjoy the film is to know as little about it as possible and let Anderson take you on a dark and Gothic thrill ride.,1
" An elegantly crafted drama that derives its eerie, ethereal mood as much from the sounds of war -- and their absence -- as the sights of combat.",1
 The genius of Museum Hours lies in the way Jem Cohen ties the minimalist story at the movie's center with the extraordinary art that fills his frame.,1
" I didn't walk out of Monster with that ""great"" movie feeling, which is not to say it wasn't ""great."" Profound fits better.",1
" If you've ever wanted to see a partially clothed, fully comical sex scene set to Foreigner's 'I Want to Know What Love Is,' well, this is where you go. ",1
" Once we know what the couple's big mystery is, ""By the Sea"" doesn't make sense and begins to seem the one thing it hasn't all along - silly.",0
" Bundled with Dirty Grandpa and Bad Neighbours 2, the release of this forgettable, scatter-brained R-rated comedy belch marks the completion of Zac Efron's informal film trilogy, the chief message of which appears to be ""I will now say 'yes' to anything"".",0
 The Sunlit Night has a few too many forced moments and scripted relationship beats to feel genuine.,0
" Urgent, graceful, accessible and at times openly cheerful -- it takes a big bite out of life.",1
" True, it tries to be tongue-in-cheek, but really it's just cheek.",0
 Dan Gilroy's Velvet Buzzsaw needed to be either thirty minutes shorter or an hour longer.,0
" It wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads, beatific smile and durable songs of love, hope and longing. In this task it succeeds admirably.",1
" Their real, unstated missions are more in the nature of relocating their souls and finding some elusive peace of mind.",1
" Story's whiter-than-white skin, bloody cuts, color-shifting hair, and need to keep wet make her a bizarre amalgamation of fantasies, alternately ""male"" and ""childish.""",0
" If The Wind Rises is indeed the final film from Hayao Miyazaki -- the animation master has both announced and rescinded his retirement -- he leaves us with a moving, meaningful farewell.",1
" Does not abide by conventional storytelling, and yet one cannot deny that it is genuinely creepy.",1
" The attractive actors are easy to watch, though their silent, enigmatic performances deliberately withhold information from the viewer until the end. Without social interaction of any kind, they remain abstract, symbolic figures.",0
 Pushes the same old cliches in Blade Runner packaging.,0
" [Wynter] simply doesn't show the stuff of a major star, and the well-mounted movie falls flat all around her.",0
" Gordon Gekko is back, but he's not as powerful a force as he once was.",0
" Light on intelligent humour, heavy on the slapstick, the result is once again a mixed bag; an animated effort which will please the young viewers, but not anyone older than maybe 10.",0
" Thankfully, Dead Men Tell No Tales delivers a strikingly heartfelt conclusion to the series and its ever-present lead. ",1
" The message of Morning Glory -- that austere TV journalists could stand to lighten up a bit -- may be dubious, but Michell and his cast sell it persuasively.",1
 It doesn't have the wit and it doesn't have the style of the best Bond movies.,0
" If there's a problem with 'The Hangover' (and other films of its ilk), it's the at best ambivalent, at worst hostile relationship to women...",1
 Demonstrates Capra's skill at tweaking the heartstrings as well as the funny bone.,1
" A finely crafted Western which doesn't flinch from portraying the horrors inflicted during that violent era, and which boasts an astounding performance from Christian Bale.",1

" This film is funny, but despite its subject matter, or perhaps because of it, this is a movie without a soul.",0
" This sequel, which starts off promisingly, soon bogs down, its relish for tawdry, hyper-violent titillation eventually becoming as monochromatic as the black-and-white images.",0

 Director Bertrand Bonello ... weave[s] a languorous but transfixing portrait of artistic life and the decadence that often comes with it. ,1

 This film is meant for you to leave with your own assessment of state-sanctioned violence and it doesn't try to do the work of figuring that out for you---I appreciated that. ,1

 Writer-director Georgina Garcia Riedel's feature debut is so good for so long that it breaks the heart to watch the film lose its way.,1

" Relying on familiar devices like startling sounds, ominously opening doors and incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo about astral-projection and demonic possession, it's a deja-'boo,' a waste of time and money.",0
" In almost every crucial way, ""The Yellow Birds"" is a flat and listless piece of moviemaking, a monotonous indie dirge that will probably end up fighting hard to win even a tiny audience.",0
" The filmmaker's sense of humor is deadpan, but it might work better in the format of a half-hour sitcom.",0
 ...a minor addition to the Schwarzenegger oeuvre,0
 Fincher's chief delight seems to be in playing with genre conventions: what looks like an especially moody whodunit morphs first into a psychosexual thriller and then into what might just be straight-faced satire.,0
" For fans of Barrymore and Sandler's previous cinematic encounters, this latest effort isn't up to snuff, losing the sweetness and friendly playfulness that elevated their past screen adventures.",0
" Although the writing's exploration of common humanity across the social divide offers occasional worthwhile moral provocation, its evident theatricality also works against any sense of urban authenticity.",0
" [Gibson] delivers a performance very few could pull off as a depressed father who begins communicating through a hand puppet, but Foster doesn't know how to manage it or navigate the script's seismic tonal shifts/",0
" Kyle did a great service to his country, and saved many lives. But one need not tarnish his reputation to admit that the Iraq War was a complex one; nor to point out that the life of a sniper, killing from afar, is predicated on a certain moral ambiguity.",1
" Michael Keaton is a solid lock for the year's best male actor, his supporting cast is incredible and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's play-like film is a must-see.",1
" David Ayer's film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules.",0
 Starts off as an okay film noir but then the wheels come off. Looks like a poor effort to emulate Christopher Nolan.,0
" At times this science-fiction adventure is thrilling, and it is also touching and even has its share of silly moments.",1
" Those little Minions made terrific supporting players in their two previous adventures. As main stars, they're sporadically comical, yes, but not all that interesting. They don't particularly learn anything or evolve as characters.",0
" The narration, presumably from Gallmann's book, must lose something in the translation; in Basinger's solemn readings, it sounds like ersatz greeting-card poetry.",0
" Loses its way in the third act, but James Mangold cooks up a nice mystery-thriller in the early going.",1
" Perhaps the lesson to be learned is that just because we can use computer technology to give dogs goofy faces, that doesn't mean we should.",0
" Competently made, this rather bleak film set in the disturbing, ugly reality of drug trafficking and depraved killings, feels rather routine",0
" The Last Word, ostensibly about women journalists and cranky old women, is a movie that could've paid homage to them. Instead, it just made me miss them-even more than usual.",0
" Reign of Fire is a fun action flick, but it could have used more dragons and fewer slow moments.",1
" After a few quick nods to the profoundly unethical act at its core, the movie shrugs it off and uses it as the basis for a fairy-tale romance. This is not okay.",0
" An astoundingly sweet, lovable, immensely enjoyable little film that hits all the right notes as you're watching it thanks to its excellent cast.",1
" The ideas the film explores are worthy, but the execution is disappointing. Monsters and Men feels unfinished... The film contains the start of an important conversation, but the credits roll on an incomplete thought.",0

" Paterson offers a modest, slow-burning fanfare for the common man.",1
 Style over substance -- but what style!,1
" Don't let the frilly costumes, courtly language and historical pretense fool you: ""Anonymous"" is still a Roland Emmerich movie - a blessing when it comes to vigor and a curse when it comes to subtlety, proportion or sense.",0

" Besides the impressive visuals, the film makes relatively solid use of its impressive cast.",1
 Writer-director Lorene Scafaria's film is an unconvincing character study that plays like a painfully unfunny sitcom. ,0

" It's a good act for the actor-director, who expands on the kvetchy character central to so many of his movies.",1
 Too bad the depiction of their ultimate rescue operation lacks the urgency exhibited by the cast.,0
" As a horror flick, even one held to the impossibly low standards of the found-footage variety, Alien Abduction fails to thrill or chill.",0
" The most critical element of Winter's documentary is not the scandal itself, but the fact that hundreds of journalists from around the world were able to work together to expose this corruption, despite the consequences, and their egos.",1
 The story gets neutered into an Austenesque romantic drama that stereotypes and fails to get beneath the pretty surface of its period costumes and landscapes.,0
" The crowded compositions convey a sense of life in the dense Asian city-state, but also the intimacy of this semi-autobiographical story.",1
" ""Goodnight Mommy"" is an unusually suspenseful and thought-provoking film.",1
" Its humor is broad, but most of the jokes work for the intended audience - with a few even breaking through to more resistant viewers.",1
" It's filled with nice little moments of trenchant drollery, kind of like a really good political humor blog.",1
" As it stands, the only thing London Fields has going for it is that it's messy and weird enough to hopefully provoke those who have never read Amis to consider trying him out.",0
" Gill's debut offers nothing but incessant needle-drops instead of drama; modern life may be rubbish, but there's no need for modern romances to be so utterly naff.",0

 Alice in Wonderland lands in a comfortable zone that should accommodate both kids and adults.,1

" Daniels' uneven, lopsided narrative goes too far in spots and not nearly far enough in others.",0
" The movie plays best as a joke on Disney. The critique of the corporation and its theme parks, however, is lame and not at all new",1

 The Program delivers an efficient overview of the scandal and builds tension despite the inevitability of the outcome.,1

" You, Me and Dupree is a situation comedy that subsists purely on vibe, namely Owen Wilson's ever-boyish vibe of an innocence that has overstayed its welcome long into adulthood.",0
" Sooner or later, you have to serve up something more compelling than an abattoir. For Wolf Creek 2, that's the only purpose of the exercise.",0
 Come[s] together in its closing minutes and - no small compliment - will repay a second viewing. There's a cult out there waiting for Cellar Door.,1
" What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'",0

 The Clan throws new light and invites us to reflect on the loss of values on society. It's a shame that the author's stand on the subject is so murky. [Full review in Spanish],0
 This penultimate entry in the series lacks the life and the imagination of its worthy predecessors.,0
 Director Irwin Winkler's highly stylized technique is difficult to connect with emotionally.,0
" It adds up to a giant slog, a movie that, despite its ambitious look, doesn't manage to offer us anything new. In the Screen Age, we'd refer to it as an epic fail.",0
" The latest iteration of ""Fantastic Four"" is far from what its name suggests. Profoundly uninteresting, it hits all the beats of the standard superhero movie, but provides nothing in the way of imagination or magic.",0
" The predecessor to the Hollywood blockbuster The Ring, Hideo Nakata's low-budget original packs some scares but skimps on characterization.",1
" The Punisher is a shame, an example of a good story turned to crap.",0
 Instead of a classic along the lines of As Good as It Gets; Spanglish is merely a pleasant diversion. Sandler's surprise turn makes it worth a viewing.,1

 This film from 1932 shows Renoir's gift for storytelling and comedy.,1
 Either make the apes' progression of power intense and frightening or ridiculous and fun. Trying for both doesn't work.,0
 Deruddere muddles the film by not allowing much variation in mood.,0
 It's a compressed sprawling life's tale of common folk torn by man's intolerance and a family's pain. And an under-nourishing meal.,1
" With a more relatable main character and more emotional investment, 'Landing Up' could've been a more plausible and moving motion picture.",1
" For a film at least partially about magic (and, ""science-magic""), it lacks a decided bit of that necessary misdirection, and the proceedings are often predictable. Sleight is, well, slight.",1
 It has a better chance of boring you to death than inducing fear. ,0
 [Fantastic Four should] simply be ignored for the unremarkable-and completely familiar-corporate bowel movement that it is.,0

" Aqua Teen Hunger Force is clearly designed to appeal to fans of the show. For the rest of us, its appeal may be something of a stretch.",0

" It's all very confusing and I have to admit, I'm not sure I even liked ""Trash Humpers."" But, I respect it and I respect Korine as an artist.",1
" The special effects are cheap and not at all impressive. For a series that relies heavily on sword fighting, it too is surprisingly second-rate.",0
" Fails to resolve the fascist implications of Stark's claim to have 'privatized world peace'; here, Stark's human and machine sides correlate to Klaatu and Gort in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' who demanded the world accept a robot police force...",1
 Norman is highly recommended.,1
" Dunham's on-screen mixture - essentially all the S's (sadness, structurelessness, serendipity) - is stirred so skilfully it makes recent indie cinema of extemporisation, from mumblecore to Miranda Otto, seem like am-dram.",1

 Best filed alongside tandoori chicken pizza in the list of hybrid recipes that should never have left the kitchen ...,0
 The artists' blathering about the creative process and the nature of existence gets monotonous. It's the ordinary folk that keep the film on-track.,1
 A soulless special effects flick crossed with a tired gross-out comedy.,0
" Finding Neverland wants us to believe, but instead of desperately forcing itself on our inner-child, the film takes its time and allows us in of our own accord.",1
" Viktor is amiable; he's not going to make anyone nervous, as he might if he was, for instance, ""Middle Eastern.""",0
" For the most part, however, the movie strikes its own great tone, mixing the anxious comedy of realistically awkward romantic exchanges with Rebel Wilson's more over-the-top but effectively comic antics.",1
" Even if (Wesley) Snipes zombie-walks through his part, how can you hate a horror-action flick that lets the vampire dogs out?",1
 Spider-Man: Homecoming is better than Spider-Man 3 but not by much.,0

 Vera Farmiga's stunning performance saves this hokum.,1
 The tone in Killer Joe feels so expertly and delicately crafted that we only laugh at the film's absurd scenarios if and when the filmmaker permits it so.,1
 Wheatley remains a master of infusing the mundane with overtones of dread.,1
 Prepare for some chills and thrills if you're heading to check out Daniel Radcliffe's post-Potter debut.,1
" The closer the character gets to actually firing up his rocket, the less fun the film becomes. The Polish brothers lose their goofy sense of humor, and The Astronaut Farmer turns serious and, heaven help us, inspiring.",0
" ""Collateral Beauty"" couldn't be more calculated and manipulative if it slapped you on the back, shoved a giant lollipop into your mouth and immediately tried to sell you a time share in Tampa.",0
" It is nothing more than a good time for all the family. Which, considering that's all it clearly wants to be, means it pleasantly delivers.",1
 Watching this series of adrenalin charged set pieces and plot twists feels like hurtling down a series of narrow one-way streets with tyre -screeching corners in between.,1
" Alluringly smooth and uncluttered, as if taking its cue from one of the tracking shots so beloved by its subject.",1
 Completely engaging and packing a surprising emotional wallop. (Parental Review also Available),1
" After a rough start and an unsure handle on what kind of comedy it wants to be, this Afghanistan war satire says what few have been willing to say.",1
" Volume II isn't without its visual and dramatic achievements, but with the initial details of Joe's descent fading into memory, it's difficult to recall what made the material so interesting in the first place.",1
" There's a long barroom bikini contest, complete with wet t-shirt, that goes on too long when it shouldn't be going on at all.",0
" Battle of the Sexes is a film that needs to wrap together several concerns into its overarching feminist manifesto and it just didn't have the time to deal with everything properly. Consequently, it feels like some steps were skipped over.",1
 As always in director/co-writer Shane Black-and this goes back to his cantaloupe-testicled actioners of the 1980 like The Last Boy Scout: Why waste energy mocking a convention that it might be better to do without in the first place? ,1
" The film's (partial) salvation comes - oddly enough - from Robin Williams, an actor I'd just about given up on.",0
 An enjoyably fawning documentary.,1
" If there is such a thing as a warm-bath movie, The Second Best Marigold Hotel defines it. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy just get better with age in a mild comedy that celebrates life to the very end. ",1
" While the presence of pro boarders doing their thing might be a selling point for enthusiasts, the predominantly lame goings-on will leave others snow-bored.",0
" A terrifically enjoyable piece of old-fashioned storytelling and a beautiful-looking film: spectacular, exciting, funny and fun.",1
 When the action pivots on the exciting plot point of data transfer rates ... this mundane crisis doesn't seem elevated to a planetary level of urgency.,0

 This Miss deserves to be a hit.,1
 An example of photojournalism at its finest.,1
 The entertainment that one is able to derive from it is directly proportional to the appeal of each character. Those levels vary widely.,0
" This very thinly sliced character study of beautiful if benighted adolescence is more a pre-coming-of-age tale, one that takes us close to, but not through, the transformative acquisition of good judgment.",0
" Thank heavens, then, for Lawrence. Even though the storyline lacks conviction, she has the passionate intensity of the kind of leader you might just be willing to follow into one more film.",1
 The Fourth Kind has a clever gimmick and nothing more.,0
 A lot of footage of Gerard Butler skulking around dark hallways and neutralizing terrorists.,0
 The Babadook doesn't just tower over this year's other fright films: It's one of the most emotionally affecting pieces of macabre cinema in years. ,1

" More concerned with gimmicky jokes and facile comparisons than either artful filmmaking or reasoned analysis, Michael Moore has made an adulatory travelogue of Europe's best policies that offers little nuance and even less insight.",0
" ...so convoluted, idiotic and preachy that it plays like M. Night Shyamalan adapting the Left Behind books. Only dopier.",0
 Attempt to duplicated the Tim Burton formula without Burton. It doesn't work.,1
" It's one of those films where the characters always seem to be Behaving, as if ordinary life has to be jacked up into eccentricity.",0
 It stops developing character too soon... that said... it really did remind me of having reading the manga even though I haven't in a long time.,1
" Juanita, with subtle lighthearted charm, mixes drama and laughter to tell a story of a Black woman who prioritizes self-care in order to not be eaten alive by the rat race of life. ",1
 I had a great time watching it.,1
 Delightfully demented hitman comedy hits the mark.,1
 Eight Crazy Nights is ... a fable of redemption that paradoxically confirms the protagonist in his degradation.,0

 Rendering this film fairly pointless.,0
" Hey, it's ""Fatal Attraction Lite.""",0
 The reason this movie works more deeply than just a star studded action romp is the attention to tone. Action movies are more than just a string of cool scenes. There's more that goes into creating a world where we invest in the ridiculous.,1
" The Huntsman: Winter's War having so many good bits made me me more frustrated than if it had been a wall-to-wall mediocre movie. Because there is potential, and it was squandered. ",0
" When it's being its goofy funny self, it scores.",1
" There are moments of comedy, of eternal sadness, hope, and emptiness. The varying ranges are impressive.",1
" This is not a great achievement by any means, but the director's consistent display of enthusiasm allows it to stay afloat long enough to get its point across.",1

" Unflinching, level-headed and filled with compelling characters, Murderball is an exuberant testament to the joys of being alive and tingling with physical confidence.",1
" [CANNES 2016] ""Bacalaureat"" suffers from too many narrative threads that don't resolve. The film's climax feels pedestrian even if the filmmakers' intentions ring true.",0
 Might be the most affectionate look back at old-school entertainment since Peter O'Toole boozed his way through My Favorite Year.,1
" Strong on performance, atmosphere and production design, but undermined by some less than judicious editing and some frustratingly fuzzy characterisation.",1
 I would be willing to toss Miss Bala into my ever-growing pile of disappointments if it weren't such an aggressive waste of Gina Rodriguez's talent. She's capable of so much more that this and we all deserve better from her.,0
" For reasons that never become apparent, Jordan elects to play the growing mayhem straight, and the movie drags its toneless, spiritless way to the edifying conclusion that there is 'no peace anywhere.' How true. How banal.",0
" By keeping the mood downbeat, director Niall Heery squeezes some extra mileage out of a cliche-ridden idea.",1

 Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's anonymous work here could've been overseen by any hipster looking to make a mark at Platinum Dunes. ,0
" Ultimately, the finale will have audience members on their feet, but for the wrong reason - not as part of a standing ovation but in an effort to beat a hasty retreat to the exit.",0
 The only thing more boring than a vampire with moral issues about biting people in the neck is a werewolf who'd rather become fully human than howl at the moon once a month.,0
" Micmacs is Jeunet's whimsy unrestrained; this is hardcore twee, uncut cute. Every character on screen is quirky and eccentric to various degrees of irritation, and the constant visual whizbang stuff never lets the actors interact.",0
" The film - if it can be called that - is touted as an examination of the modern Arab world, but the first hour or so is an eyeball-frying collage of visuals and sound.",1
" At its best, Spider-Man takes the adolescent yearning at the heart of most superhero sagas and gives it a lovely swing.",1
" Though not as preposterously enraged as The Interpreter, the film still chooses to fan the flames of liberal guilt from a safe distance.",0

" While the film effectively captures Dustin's ambivalence and melancholy about giving up on baseball, the love story isn't nearly persuasive, and Dustin's core failure as a person...just feels like a device lifted from bigger sports dramas.",0
 Obviously Idris Elba is very well-versed in the music and the style and the cultures that this story is dealing with and he evokes them in such a way that you feel that you are really there.,1

" Diggs' charisma goes a long way toward drawing the audience in. We're rooting for him to succeed. And yeah, his dopey friend, too.",1

 A fascinating and genuinely important period in American history is underserved here by an inelegant structure and unwieldy running time.,0

" There is no fault in the new stars of the latest John Green book-to-movie adaptation and this teen dramedy is a slight cut above the norm in the genre even if a lot of it doesn't add up. Still, it's got heart and a nice theme about living life to the max.",1

" It is a little reticent about his private life - but a persuasive, stimulating work.",1
" Every single actor in ""Steve Jobs"" is immensely gifted, with Fassbender leading the charge. ",1
" The movie never comes close to replicating the spell that Reiniger was able to cast using much more primitive techniques, which underlines a chronic problem of computer animation: its very precision squeezes all the magic from the magic lantern.",0

" When the Titans last clashed two years ago, their dialogue was idiotic, their plot machinations impenetrable and their 3-D process an add-on disaster. The best I can say for this sequel-not such a bad best-is that you'll want to keep your 3-D glasses on.",0

" While never fully satisfactory at either, it is a comedy with some nice laughs, and a romance with some sweet moments.",0
" It's a film bristling with vivid moments and unbeatable acting, but its interest is not in tidy narrative satisfactions but rather the excesses and extremes of human behavior, the interplay of troubled souls desperate to find their footing.",1

 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a profoundly dissatisfying film.,0
" The Romanian Tourist Board will not like what it sees, not will much of the audience.",0

" That we never really glean who ""the Danish girl"" is is quite fitting since the filmmakers also haven't the slightest idea who their characters really are.",0
 Captain Marvel is a must-see superhero film. It pushes all the right buttons in bringing the audience to the edge of their seat and rooting for the newest and first standalone female superhero film in the MCU.,1
" Two years after going AWOL from his hit Comedy Central show, Dave Chappelle makes a tentative foray back into the limelight with a good old-fashioned concert film that, surprisingly, features very little of Chappelle himself.",1
" An interminable illusive boondoggle with clunky turns and a flat, uninspiring reveal.",0
" Torok's powerfully absorbing tale juggles multiple characters and themes -- guilt, greed, justice. It's imperfect, but it has a crucial message about the complicity of ""little people"" in the context of unfathomably bigger crimes.",1
 Not even a marketing campaign designed by Don Draper himself could sell this boondoggle.,0
" Given the partisan divide, the documentary probably will be of interest only to people who already admire Justice Ginsburg, but it's a good story that will inspire many and should appeal to anyone with an open mind.",1
 Trapped inside the seemingly harmless veneer of a PG-rated kid's movie lies a mischievous little devil of a film...,1
" As an undemanding, cheery children's movie it entertains, and the acting is fine all-round, but fans of the book risk disappointment on a grand scale.",0
 A deliciously snarky tale of corruption and malfeasance most foul that could have only gone down in South Florida. Corben directs this juicy yarn like the smart aleck in class who can't seem to stay out of trouble.,1
 Manages to be simultaneously magisterial and dull.,0
" The plot's development is obvious and then ridiculous, and the numerous fights and chases all begin to look alike after a while.",0
 One of The Birth of a Nation's biggest weaknesses is that the film's female characters are given little consideration in comparison to their male counterparts. ,0
 Polanski does an excellent job evoking an increasing sense of paranoia and danger.,1

 This is for Christmas movie masochists only.,0
" Amazingly, Spielberg... has managed to suppress his own worst excesses and create a movie that does justice to Dick's ideas.",1

" If you feel outraged and a little sick watching the people in The Bling Ring, it's because Coppola wants you to feel that way. You're not reacting against the movie, but with it.",1
" Every scene shift contributes vital information about what it means to guide or be guided over foreign territory, both emotional and physical.",1
" At times the film is a darkly comedic glimpse into the treatment of the mentally ill, including Juno Temple as Sawyer's vicious and crude bunkmate, Violet, and Jay Pharaoh as Nate, the only patient sympathetic to her argument.",1
" This film, recently restored to Welles' original, full-length version, is well worth seeing.",1
 The film is most interested in homing in on the ways Nadia Murad's fragility and self-doubt arise as collateral damage from her fame and steadfast activism.,1
" Thank goodness for Fey, who lends this sitcom soap a credible emotional center.",1
" Yet another disappointment! Grosse Pointe Blank is full of possibilities (a great hook, a sharp cast, and a wry cynicism that is shamefully lacking from film these days) but comes up short on all sides.0",0
 Works hard in an effort to recapture the fizzy thrills of action-centric Pixar flicks like 'The Incredibles'.,0
" A dark comedy that confirms Diablo Cody as a screenwriter of importance, eliminates the last shred of doubt that Jason Reitman is a major director and gives Charlize Theron her best showcase since ""Monster.""",1
" The imagery is colorful and artfully rendered, but the filmmakers, favoring technological wizardry over story, have beefed up the narrative with teeming rodent civilizations, a seafaring sequence, and gladiatorial action pieces.",0
" When the best parts of a science fiction film are its set designs, that's not a good thing. ",0
" Sandler doesn't appear to be trying terribly hard, and Gad gets sucked into that humor vacuum, going after laughs with a palpable desperation and adopting Sandler's signature move of yelling for no apparent reason.",0

 The film is visualized in such a straightforward manner that it feels as if it could have been made in 1950. There's not a moment of freshly imaginative or unconventional footage. ,0

 A worthy but lifeless passion project.,0

 A textbook example of how not to make a horror film.,0

" Side Effects is, ultimately, another example of the director's commitment to fine craftsmanship above any identifiable fingerprint.",1
" The big question hanging over the much-anticipated film version of novelist Tom Clancy's best-seller The Hunt for Red October is how, in the current world climate,this cold war thriller will stand up to the warm glow of glasnost. The answer is: just fine.",1

" It's true, Venom is a bit of a catastrophe. It is a bad, bizarre and baffling entity of a film. But do you know something? I could not take my eyes off it. We have a hilariously over-the-top Tom Hardy to thank for that.",0
" The production is amateurish and cheap-looking, but two decent performances are worth mentioning: Chris Klein as a sensitive jock and Alyson Hannigan as a nerdy flute player.",0
 Predictably formulaic romantic comedy that's as bleak as the Minnesota-in-winter landscape,0
 The conceit of No Sleep 'Til Christmas is a stretch. That it actually manages to sell it is nothing short of a miracle.,1

" As director, [Bruce Campbell] trips through gory gags and gallows humor with more tenacity than talent, while onscreen he mugs shamelessly.",0
 The songs become repetitive and seem like merely a different way to present familiar material.,0
" The film is a minor Christmas miracle: It succeeds on its own terms, despite the gossip hounds' best blood-sniffing efforts, and dares to be an entertainment rather than a statement.",1
" ""Golden Exits"" isn't as thunderous as ""Queen of Earth,"" but accepted on a smaller scale of disturbance, and Perry's windy screenplay and care for actors is fascinating.",1
" There's little here to get the pulse racing. For a summer blockbuster, that's disappointing. For a Wolverine film, that's pretty hard to forgive.",0
" Franco's curly locks may make the target audience swoon, but his presence never allows the rest of us to completely sink into Tristan & Isolde.",0
" Even if it overstays its welcome, Cellular turns out to be a nifty thriller buoyed by solid performances and catchy riffs of humor.",1
 The strength of 'Beatriz' relies more on the performances of Salma Hayek (as the sad and almost saintly title character) and the always-great John Lithgow (as the rather simply named Doug Strutt) than its obvious screenplay.,0

" Everything, Everything has the style to draw in fans of the Young Adult genre, but it lacks the substance to truly resonate when compared to other (better) YA films.",0
" Be careful what you wish for, and also what you buy into.",0
" The flatness and stiff, jerky movement of the drawing contribute to the dreamlike, increasing dread-filled atmosphere of the visuals, which burst finally into actual filmed images of devastating impact.",1

" When it's over you may notice red marks on your throat, so determined is ""Unfinished Song"" to strangle the audience into emotional submission.",0
" ""Everybody Knows"" may not be the best crime thriller out there, but it has enough going for it to merit some strong consideration.",1
 There's a subtly meaningful power to what the film actually does: witnessing the awkwardness that ensues when the creatively free try to communicate with people who lack the context to understand unfettered expression.,1

" To say the film is sitcom-y is to belabor the obvious. ""Ramona and Beezus"" is a welcome throwback to the nuclear-family-centered sitcoms of the 1950s and '60s and a low-tech charmer, and the cast elevates it all, especially King.",1
 Instead of giving in and approaching the humanity of all story that is entertaining but not exactly enriching. [Full review in Spanish],0

 The hard-won consolations of seasonal sentiment emerge in the searching performances as well as in the impressionistic handheld images.,1
" The real kick of the material is had when the characters are forced to fly their way out of tight situations, or reduce a team of aggressors to a heaving pile of wounded groans.",1

" The Hangover Part 2 definitely has its moments and a few big laughs throughout, but the most memorable thing about this second substance-induced amnesia comedy is how ultimately forgettable it is.",0
" Emotional cruelty through sexual manipulation is the rule of the game of this smooth transfer of Christopher Hampton's witty play, with an all-American cast, headed by Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer.",1
" This dreamy, visually inventive Iranian drama functions on so many levels of reality and obsession that it almost ceases to entertain.",1

" Fellini's masterpiece, which won the Foreign-Language Oscar, features Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife) in her most heart-breaking performances, playing a naive prostitute who endures an endless series of devastating misfortunes with her soul intact.",1
" Little Men is a sweet, deceptively slight movie about boyhood friendship and parental conflict set against the backdrop of a gentrified New York.",1
" Lest someone cry 'pompous puritan,' let's quickly state that irreverence is often at the heart of inspired comedy. But this flick's flamboyant political incorrectness is more malicious than mischievous.",0
" The brightest attraction in this gripping potboiler is the cast, which is loaded to the gills with high pedigree actors like Isabelle Huppert, who comes just shy of stealing the show as Rapace's comically deaf mother. ",1
" Derogatory dismissals of prosaic visual experiences have been around since, well, someone was bored to tears. To the poetic hyperbole of watching paint dry, or grass grow, we can now add: watching a writer write.",0

 The director's gorgeous images go some way towards making that message go down easier. But that is where his restraint ends.,0

 Cooper is a rather pitiful caricature of a hapless blonde redeemed only by the actress's innate likeability which not even the crass script can totally suppress.,0
" [Rebecca] Miller loves these characters, too much to paint any of them as villains, and if Maggie's plans are complicated by the vagaries of human desire, her happy ending feels fully earned.",1
 This thing is fun to hear and must have been even more fun to perform. That's why great actors keep getting drawn to Sorkin's work.,1

" After all the expense and time New Line spent on the film, it's likely to be forgotten by moviegoers within a month.",0
" I'm going out on a limb here: I actually think the movie might work well as a dark comedy on subsequent viewings. I certainly laughed at all kinds of 'wrong' moments, mostly because of Hardy's outrageous accent.",1
 Real-life friends Diggs and Casal must have less of an unstable dynamic than their characters; the two actors wrote Blindspotting together and perform a potentially fraught duet as its leads.,1

" Crowd-pleasing without compromising on its uniqueness, the result has romcom structure but a beguiling adventure mood reminiscent of the best US indies.",1
 The great film to vindicate Spanish zombie cinema. [Full Review in Spanish],1
" The film strikes a quiet, contemplative tone that befits its soft-spoken subjects rather than the tumultuous times in which they lived.",1
" Quarantine is symptomatic of a broken industry; one that would rather remake a perfectly good foreign language film with nice, safe, recognisable American faces rather than plough any money into original concepts.",0
 This is a one-riff movie and instant cult classic.,1
" Overreaching, but damning. ",1
" Coogan and Brydon are locked into a routine that reliably amuses but, perhaps, one they have mastered too well to examine their own privilege.",1
" The plot is a sideshow to Inherent Vice's luxuriant atmosphere, cracked sense of humor, and idiosyncratic characterization.",1
" Oh brother, George, where art thou going with this?",0
" A dreamlike, sometimes downright disorientating experience sustained by a tender heart beating beneath harsh realism.",1

" Soderbergh's creative shot composition and off-kilter pacing elevate some of the story's prosaic elements, but he doesn't take enough narrative or stylistic chances.",0
" South African director Gavin Hood, who won a well-deserved best foreign language Oscar for Tsotsi,""knows how to turn the screws. There's more anxiety in four minutes of Eye in the Sky than there is in the entirety of Batman v Superman.",1

" There are only so many times you can use the word ""formulaic"" before your voice becomes nothing more than white noise.",0

" Although not up to the high standard of writer-director Ti West's previous film The House of the Devil, The Innkeepers is another often chilling exercise in building mood and atmosphere.",1

" In many ways, Strange Nature plays out like a throwback thriller - in a good way - until it's undone by an uneven final act.",1
 Dour and pretentious to the point of pain.,0
 Patti Cake$ [exerts] only a tenuous hold on our hearts.,0
" The Hateful Eight is too extreme, too ghoulishly violent, too besieged by its ensemble's overriding villainy, to feel like anything but a dark chamber piece. ",0
" If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.",0
" In terms of the action genre, American Assassin gives you everything you'd want out of this type of film, including explosions, car chases, and tightly choreographed fight sequences. ",1
 Machete brings director Robert Rodriguez's career full circle and emerges as one of his very best films.,1
" A thin sprinkling of exuberance and a couple of choice cameos, that's about all this underwritten and overly choreographed spectacle has to tease us with.",0
" But of [Hitchcock's] non-suspense films, I Confess may be his greatest triumph.",1
" It's pointed about how we treat today's zealots, as when Clavius likens the pain of crucification to ""sucking air through a wet cloth"" - a description of waterboarding.",0
" Frankly, one expects a little more from Robert Rodriguez",0
" Though the visuals are often gorgeous, the dramatic elements don't always work quite as well as they should because there is not enough attention given to them.",0
" Sadly, any hoped-for chemistry rarely materializes in a landslide of mostly mean-spirited humor.",0
 its dream cast makes its flaws easy to ignore,1
" ""Red Hook Summer"" has so much life, so much verve. Spike Lee always makes movies you want to wrestle with, even if the rewards this time around aren't as worthwhile.",1
" ""Carrie may go out in a blaze of glory, but Kimberly Peirce's film barely raises enough heat to make it worth pulling the alarm.""",0
" Just when you thought Sandler couldn't embarrass himself any further, he drops the laughless mess known as Sandy Wexler on Netflix subscribers.",0
" Looks aren't everything. Case in point: Sucker Punch, a dazzling visual design that goes tone-deaf every time it opens its dumb mouth or makes claims to profundity.",0
 Sometimes you pan a deadpan comedy because it's effectively dead.,0
" Destined for a long life in museums and history classes alike, this is cinema as art, and a classic.",1
" A dreary, uninformative, emotionless disaster. At least Alexander had the comical benefit of Angelina Jolie hamming it up with reptiles.",0
" Misses every mark it's aiming at, and then misses countless more.",0
" Exciting, entertaining, and opens the door to reflection through historical context. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" ""Everything, Everything"" doesn't even set up a bar for Maddy and Olly to overcome, instead insisting on the idea that we should just make believe like mindless children.",0

" An uncompromising experiment in how much suffering a soul can take, both on screen and in one's cinema seat.",0
" ... So bad that it rockets through the gauntlet of insipidity and tastelessness and emerges on the other side to become good, only to ricochet off the wall of cinematic decency and become bad all over again.",0
" Yes, Julianne Moore will win the Oscar. And yes, this in one depressing film.",1
" It is an incomprehensible, enjoyable, uninhibited slapstick romp.",1
" This is Spielberg's way of showing that these warriors were ordinary men -- men who, if they survived, became the grandfathers and great-grandfathers who, these days, pass largely unnoticed through life.",1
" To be fair to this film, and I can't see why I should be, it is an improvement on Peter Benchley's book. ",0
" Opulent but chaotic Korean historical epic with way too much going on, keeping you at arm's length from becoming truly engaged.",0
 A crowd-pleasing documentary about the adventures of the Soviet national ice-hockey team.,1

 The Darkest Minds was a good film and very much: what you see is what you get.,1
" This grossout comedy takes De Niro fans into a new emotional phase that I can only call ""post-despair"". We are past being astonished and horrified.",0

 Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's documentary raises important questions about the limits of pedagogy.,1
 A less satisfying retread of Russell's favorite family-weighs-a-great-person-down storyline.,0

" As with Goodfellas, Scorsese's helpless attraction to the very behavior he wants to indict becomes the movie's serrated edge.",1
 Crumbles under the weight of truly insipid plotting.,0
" Should please fans, but leave them wondering what an alternate version might have looked like that wasn't afraid to get its hands dirty.",1
" It's four home-for-the-holidays comedies in one, and the variety-pack structure works for the movie: Each nightmare household has a wacked flavor all its own, and none wears out its welcome.",1
" If you've ever witnessed high-school students try to whip up SNL-type sketch comedy, everything in Wedding Crashers will have a familiar feel.",0
 Pitches so many curveballs that even its title is a joke.,1
" Like so many romantic comedies, it believes the drama is in contrived conflict.",0
" Mr. Carrey's performance is a return to the rubber-faced roles that dominated multiplexes in the mid- to late '90s, and that's not necessarily a good thing.",0
" The exacting demands of filmgoing audiences have finally drawn out the heart of this book. (Disclosure: I have not read it, but now am willing to. For the antidote to this impulse, see The Omega Man.) Adding a dog probably didn't hurt either.",1
" To be fair, anthology films are almost always hit or miss, but this one features far more of the latter.",0
" Tynan's film is laden down with aimless chatter, and its plot meanders drearily towards a country rave that seems curiously old-fashioned, and feels like a piece of Dublin's past, not its present.",0
" It's a movie that already seems like a dust-gathered statue, rather than something vividly, imaginatively crafted to reflect the burning intensity of so passionate and forward-minded an artist.",0
" It is a film about soldiers, and one of the best ever made on the subject.",1
" Despite some occasional moments of real sadness and terror, the turmoil in this movie is decidedly on the upbeat. I would love to have seen what Ruffalo could do with this part were he not encouraged to be puppyish and sweet.",0
" Creadon's managed to turn dry material into engaging cinema before with the nerderiffic Wordplay, and though I.O.U.S.A. lacks that film's narrative tension -- this time, we know who loses -- it still sugars its medicine.",1
 Finding Your Feet manages to transcend some of its more egregiously patronising and cringeworthy moments thanks to deeply felt performances by Imelda Staunton and Celia Imrie.,1
 Stunning cinematography.,1
" Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is a revelation. Wright steals every scene with her bright smile and perfect comedic timing. ",1
" Dolan is so impressed with his own aesthetics that he insists that half the movie contain ass-numbingly long slow-motion shots, just so you can savor it.",0
" An ideal example of how a remake should be, not necessarily supplanting the original film but nicely complementing it.",1
" If ever McCarthy can find the right balance between these brief revelatory scenes and the overloaded gags of her improvising insults and knocking things off shelves in a huff, she might actually make a real movie.",0
" Darin's life is just a jumping-off point for The Kevin Spacey Show, which would probably stink like hubris were Spacey not such a dazzling, enthusiastic performer.",1
" Vacth, like the movie, is beautiful and resolutely humorless.",0
" If only Russell trusted Mangano's true story. Instead, he's turned her life into a over-staged mess of awkward exposition, contrived dialogue, and characters so willfully unreal they feel acrylic.",0
 It's possible you're more impressed with the filmmaker's bravado than with anything the characters are doing onscreen.,1
" It's slickly executed, handsomely acted for the most part and utterly easy to forget.",0
 The raspy-voiced troubadour is celebrated in the mesmerizing documentary Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.,1
" The Lost Boys, which attempts to be funny while preserving the shock value of the vampire legend, aims somewhat higher... and misses.",0
" Weekend has romance to spare, but also takes a look at the cogs turning under the surface of any thoughtful encounter, however brief.",1
" It is reminiscent of a war movie...the football impact scenes are brutal and the sound editors have the volume on high for each wince-inducing hit, underscoring the disposability of the boys...",1
" The whole vaguely pitiable enterprise has tiny flickers of brilliance which can't be denied, but almost can't be detected, either.",0
 A film that lacks complex human dimension to fill out this likable if promotional tale of good will and achievement. ,0
 Though the film has moments that are too showy -- grandstanding scenes that hammer home the main messages too heavily -- it's a compelling yarn that deserves to find an audience.,1
" The radiation-altered members of the Fantastic Four don't show their humanity. Rather, the superpowered quartet is little more than a bland collection of four-color caricatures.",0
 There's a bizarre lack of anything to care about beyond the dynamic duo at the center of the film. Chan and Tucker can only carry an audience so far.,0
 ...if you can keep up with the arcane British legal process...it's an entertaining thriller highlighted by fine acting.,1
" A well-made, effective chiller...I would have admired and respected it better, though, if it wasn't so subtly judgmental toward (Gwyneth) Paltrow's ""patient zero"" character.",1
" Eschews any semblance of exploring an antisocial man in a heightened situation in favour of a stock-standard, twist-oriented action-thriller.",0
 It makes Yellow Submarine look like a miracle of sober narrative.,0
" Along with excellent work by cinematographer Stefan Duscio and composer Dale Cornelius, Petroni elicits sharp performances from his estimable cast, especially Adrien Brody.",1
" It's so full of life and motion, it's fit to burst.",1
 It's Eggers minus Eggers - a whimsical tale that aspires to make its whimsy count for something deep.,0
" A blandly predictable sports movie given some kind of disreputable interest by inserting itself into the mythology of an iconic, if not particularly high-quality franchise.",0
" Although many shots are out of focus (face it, movie cameras were still evolving in 1927), some scenes look like they could have been shot last week, which makes Lang's achievement all the more awe-inspiring.",1
" Like Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood has reached the point where his movies are better when he's not in them.",0
 The leaden screenplay can be fingered for many of the film's faults. But what happened to the off-kilter film-maker last seen at work in To Die For?,0
" The Bourne Legacy is the strangest sequel to come out of the Hollywood studio system in a long, long time. It's a product of shallow studio greed and staggering creative ineptitude.",0
 Director Ridley Scott delivers a passable spy movie that has nothing to say about this region; he may as well have been directing from a monitor in his hotel suite.,0
 The haunting sounds emanating from Kevin Hart taint this watered-down and glossy reinterpretation of a 1974 David Mamet play.,0
" Mamma Mia! is not going to make you think, nor does it want to. But it will make you sing, as long as Brosnan keeps his mouth shut.",1
" If Noise takes a certain New York path and tries to gently negotiate rather than smash things, Robbins and Hurt at least manage to keep it real.",1
" While the film's purview may suggest a PBS documentary, the density of Morrison's detail and the twists in his long-game storytelling make for a constant titillating simmer of discovery, a secret history round every corner.",1
" It's garish and crazy (and in French), so it's probably not for everyone. But I can't imagine anyone getting bored.",1
" The Perfect Holiday, as many a holiday movie before it, meticulously goes through the motions, but never quite finds the magic of the season.",0
" I think the thing I like most about this film is that it will spark many, many interesting conversations. So many people will have so many takes on the film and I am really looking forward to joining the debates. ",1
 Five Dances should well impress dance aficionados even if its skimpy narrative proves less than inspired.,1
" Bipolar in its mood swings between coarse, graphic sex comedy and sweet aw-shucks love story...",0
 The tremulous collision of Xtina and the face that launched a thousand drag shows... what happens when an irresistible sex object like Aguilera meets Cher's immovable upper lip. It isn't always pretty but on occasion it's guiltily pleasurable.,0
" Jack's problem is that he's a commoner, but the movie's problem is that its script is commoner still, an enchantment-free pretext for animated action, straight-ahead storytelling and ersatz romance.",0
 The misguided rag tag ramblings of Ghost Rider will simply wipe away from one's memory bank faster than a chintzy ink-stained tattoo on a sweaty forearm.,0
" In this laugh-free turkey, one couple's humdrum suburban life gets a turbocharge when an exciting new couple moves into their cul-de-sac.",0
" Its cast is appealing, its script is often clever and imaginative, and it leaves us in much the same place as the Kramer classic: hopeful that race will someday cease to be a major issue in American life.",1
 It's a fascinating portrait of the rise and fall of a community and a movement.,1
 This is an amiable film that will provoke some chuckles.,1
 Sews us tightly into a story that not only challenges the brain but engages the heart.,1
 It's still worth the price of admission to see Curtis reprising a beloved role.,1
" Once again, Spurlock has one point to make-a point that's crushingly obvious and not particularly brave, shocking or controversial-and spends the entire movie making it over and over again.",0
" Brings every underdog theme out of the stable, making a movie with familiar themes seem as handsome as a thoroughbred, albeit one that has trouble in the homestretch.",1
" Once Sandler slumps into frame, the illusion is popped, keeping ""Pixels"" frustratingly uneven, but periodically sensational.",0
" There is no attempt to set Sands up as a great martyr, no Jesus pose or sentimental music to manipulate emotions. Hunger is interested in none of this. Instead, [McQueen] lets the bodies that sacrificed themselves tell the story they created.",1
 Roach is wise to highlight Trumbo's wit and bemused lovability while taking the lashes of persecution.,1
" part romantic comedy, part melodrama, and all Joan Allen.",1
" [A] gripping, somber German-language drama based on actual events ...",1
" [VIDEO ESSAY] The ""Star Trek"" franchise has its weaknesses, but it's still the best thing going in the sci-fi genre.",1
" Willer's essay film is obviously a cathartic experience, her documenting a family history that transcends the personal towards the universal.",1
" True-tale mountaineering nightmare combines documentary remembrance and dramatic retelling for a terrifying, transcendent experience.",1
" The silver screen has rarely felt so lacking in allure, which is either the complete opposite of the point that Spielberg is trying to make or the absolute epitome of it.",0
 The Farrelly brothers can only wring so many laughs out of excrement in Hall Pass,0
" To say it's one of the more important films to surface this year wouldn't be an understatement, but it wouldn't be an overstatement, either.",1
" It's an ""unflinching"" account of war -- ""unflinching,"" in quotes, because every moment of the film is composed to grind your face into the muck and be proud of itself for doing so.",0
 Guardians of the Galaxy is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in such hot weather.,1
" Since these aliens just live to parachute humans into their game preserve, you're left thinking they instead play canasta, cuddle with one another and hop through open fields like bunny rabbits because they sure haven't evolved to modern expectations.",0
" The film's real power lies with Knightley. She easily could have gone over the emotional top, but instead gives a measured performance that increasingly draws you in.",1
 Its attitudes and its controversies are so dated that it feels like the film was made in 1963. And have you tried to watch a teenaged dance movie from 1963 lately?,0
" I quite enjoyed ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" while I was watching it, but ultimately it feels like a minor picture on purpose, as if it had been deliberately designed to be everybody's second- or third-choice holiday film.",1
" LaBeouf is a likable and easygoing personality, but he easily turns smug and artificial on screen.",0
" Arditi and Azema stand out in this powerhouse ensemble and share one of its loveliest and saddest moments, gently holding hands in the snow.",1
 An unromantic comedy that gets down and dirty.,0
 A disappointing bore based on a 2010 John le Carre thriller.,0
" A commercial picture of high box office potential, first by assembling the most impressive aggregation so far of strictly Bradstreet screen names, and then by filming the play practically unaltered in form.",1
" There were tears on my cheeks, but I wasn't feeling a thing.",0
" The fun and merriment take a backseat to the sci-fi elements, which are probably not what the intended audience is looking for.",0
" For all its references to the show's history, the film never panders. It's an evolution of the core concept as opposed to a nostalgia-tinged reproduction, and is all the better for it.",1
" Forster's self-important direction submarines a film that begins well, but slips into melodrama and plods towards anti-climax.",0
" The Polar Express is a spectacular train ride from start to finish. The movie is much more than an awesome visual experience, however.....it also has plenty of heart.",1
 As entertaining and uplifting a film as we'll get all year.,1
" Anonymous premises Edward's manhood partly on his sexual prowess and partly on his poetry, but it loses sight of the latter's allusions and intrigues, and instead falls in love with its own most obvious sensations.",0
" Those looking for a clever, imaginative or well-made comedy will probably wish someone had served these filmmakers with cease and desist letters before they finished this failed effort.",0
" Even as Fate has its fun and chases its highs (a few of which are pretty satisfying), it's hard to shake the growing sensation that the bloom might be coming off the rose.",0
" Just when we figure out where it's going, it goes somewhere else. Just when we think it won't dare go somewhere, it does.",1
 ...always aware of how this traumatic experience would be filtered through this particular family.,1
" Without flair or fresh insights into its chosen subject, this just seems like spinning more wheels about on oft-discussed subject.",0
" [A] faster, funnier, infinitely nastier best picture Oscar contender.",1
 Tarantino perfectly balances brilliantly written dialogue with completely insane violence. I was pumping my fist in the air the entire time.,1
" Empathy rescues it from the brink of disaster porn -- it's so good-hearted and optimistic that stressed-out moms will feel the flick speaks directly to them, which it does.",1
" A frequently silly, forgettable bit of fluff.",0
 Like a John Grisham tale written by joke-happy hacks.,0
" This is a delightful journey. It doesn't quite qualify as a film, playing more like a collection of videos and interviews, but if you have the time and don't mind the slower pace, it's an enriching diversion.",1
 The film is always gorgeous. Even the realistic vileness of pre-sewerage-system London streets are a wonder to look at.,1
 Putting profane adjectives in front of every other noun in dialogue that wants desperately to sound streetwise doesn't make it feel authentic if the other words spoken by the characters are arranged into orderly little blocks of exposition.,0
" ...an effective, inspiring bit of endurance cinema. And it has Radcliffe!",1
" The decision to have an antic Tink was a bad one. [Ludivine] Sagnier's stomping, pouting, mugging fairy is a monumental distraction despite her size.",0
" Its 'Saturday Night Live'-esque parade of improbable celebrity impersonations kept me entertained: You'd probably have to attend a Halloween party hosted by Turner Classic Movies to find a less convincing John Wayne, Kirk Douglas or Edward G. Robinson.",0
" The characters, once fresh and immediate creations, move like solemn chess pieces across the screen. Each scene, once tight and energized, feels sluggish and protracted. The crisp dialogue, now flabby and perfunctory, fails to propel the narrative along.",0
 This isn't funny. It's sad and disheartening and demeaning...,0
" Like a play date that gets so totally out of hand, you just throw up your hands and just wait for everyone to go home.",0
 A sharply written tale expressing the irony that a man with five hundred million subscribers has nary a friend in the world.,1
 ... edge-of-the-seat suspenseful.,1
 Burton apparently worked on this at night while directing Dark Shadows during the day. Both movies would have benefited greatly from his undivided attention.,0
" A slapstick odd-couple adventure, punctuated with laugh-out-loud wisecracks, which still charms despite its shortcomings.",1
 The spy-game maneuverings provide some dramatic heft.,1
" Although the first half is much better than the second, Sleuth is intense, wordy, wordly and thought-provoking overall. It may not appeal to adolescent boys. Imagine that.",1
 Has a lot to say and manages to say most of it in an unexpectedly entertaining way -- and also with no small amount of poignancy.,1
" As he did in the popular ""Eden and the East"" and ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"" writer-director Kenji Kamiyama tells a complicated tale without resorting to dull explanations or pat conclusions.",1
" Rings is like a copy of a copy of a copy of an old video tape; garbled, faded and impossible to watch.",0
" Right now, Bridesmaids is the funniest movie of the year.",1
" A bigger, dumber version of the first Independence Day stripped of its best character ... and redesigned in a lab to appeal to audiences in China.",0
" It's lush, operatic, hardcore Catholic horror from the depths of ""The Omen"" and ""The Exorcist,"" with hints of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ""Black Narcissus,"" washed with medieval overtones. And it's a total, screaming blast.",1
" My opinion about this film might be conditioned because I didn't understand the argot used in it. Or maybe, there wasn't anything interesting about it. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" Alas, as directed by Lewin and written by Robert Rodat, the biopic has the feel and the trappings of a thrown-together made-for-TV item: overbearing music, flat declarative dialogue, and surprisingly broad acting from its supporting players",0
 Are you ready for a legendary love story to warm the cockles of your heart on Valentine's Day and redefine what love means in the 21st Century? Would you settle for Safe Haven?,0
 Tepid dramedy mixes a few laughs with some heavy topics.,0
" Al Gore... launches a series of new ideas that although hopefully much more than an uncomfortable truth, also make it clear that the road is far from over. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" The film follows the Rocky/Hoosiers template to the letter, not a single thing here either a surprise or shock. For some this will prove to be a winner despite that fact. For others, it will be nothing more than a shrug-inducing diversion.",0
" However, for all the period precision in the film, Colette is off kilter.",0
" At its best, this lewder, cruder spin on last year's ""Sex Drive"" has a disarmingly daffy shaggy-dog touch a la ""Half-Baked"" or ""The Brothers Solomon."" But by the time a woman enjoys champagne spiked with dog urine, ""Miss March"" is all turn-offs.",0
" The sort of movie couples will rent, sort of enjoy and stop caring about just before getting it on. In the dating world, that's called a success.",1
 Satisfying dramedy with an artery blocked heart.,1
 Even suckers for the first two American Pie courses will find this third helping indigestible.,0
" The movie's impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point.",0
" Bizarrely, Besson ... tries to shift from making fun of the main characters to sentimentalizing them.",0
" As real-life stories go, this is as riveting -- and as revealing about the dark side of American business -- as they come.",1
" All this detail makes this British-Indian co-production fascinating on many levels, and the decision to stage almost all the action in and around the Viceroy's House was an apt one.",1
" It's nothing but style and noise, threadbare of content, empty of ideas.",0
 The plot's key turning points have either too much or not enough emphasis and are often in the wrong spot.,0
 Do yourself the simple favor of seeing this sooner rather than later.,1
" Outrageously funny, thrilling and heart-warming. It's a triumphant action comedy and the first great date movie of the year. Tina Fey and Steve Carell are pure comic gold.",1
" There are problems here ... but the characterisation is feisty and memorable, the song-and-dance sequences intricate and colourful, and it'll charm the socks off little people.",1
" The director knows his way around a camera, and you can argue about the merits of the storyline. But the dialogue often sounds like it was produced by a primitive computer: Hammy and clunky.",0
 An inventive and stirring fantasy. Chances are very good that L. Frank Baum would be immensely pleased.,1
 Go back and read the play.,0
" ...as a film about rites of passage, specifically those when generally nice if dweeby boys pick up weapons and thus command the attention of hot blondes, it ends up being more than just sophomoric. It's also disquieting, and depressing. ",0
" There may be shafts of light at the conclusion of Blindness, but it's a disturbing and disquieting journey.",1
" Game Night is like playing Monopoly where the only properties are the four railroads. The players can go through the motions, but without more elements the overall result is good but far from as great as it could have been.",0
 Noble failures are still failures... no matter how hard they try.,0
" Velvet Buzzsaw is not for the easily disturbed. It takes such glee in offing its awful characters that you have to get on its wavelength. If you do, it's a bit of macabre fun.",1
" Nicholls aims high with this film. As with all its cinematic precedents, there's a race to a destination, many people involved, and at times the going can be uneven. The payoff, though, is worth it.",1
" The disjointed, episodic pace makes it an off-putting experience. ",0
 ...conventional yet compelling...,1
" It's a pitiless, primitive, primal world [Miller's] built - from its medicine to its religion to its tribal diplomacy - and it's wondrous to behold.",1
