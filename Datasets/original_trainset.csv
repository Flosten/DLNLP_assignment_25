Review,Freshness
 No movie can match Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti Western/blaxploitation/southern when it comes to illustrating the carnage wrought by slavery.,1
 Supercross is basically just a high-gloss delivery device for off-road racing scenes.,0
" The narrative dares to break the insular hermeticism reflecting that triangular intercommunication between Sergio, Sergei and Peter. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" The Burton trademark special effects are typically fun, but the late release and lackluster performances make Sleepy Hollow feel exactly like its title: sleepy and hollow.",0
" [Haluk] Bilginer's [performance] alternates between brooding melancholy and sharp-tongued contemptuousness, failing to reach the tragic dimensions which the writers intended.",0
" Another wrongheaded, stilted and obvious thriller. Yawn...",0
" Vaughn and Heche bring energy and freshness to the parts originated by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Heche is so good, in fact, and so frisky and watchable in her role, that after her grisly demise in the shower you miss her for a long time.",1
" FALLEN KINGDOM Brings Action, Forgets Characters, Awe",0
" Dumb, shallow, stilted and more cringe-inducing than sexy. It's one of the funniest unintentional comedies of the year. ",0
" The ""Divergent"" series wasn't strong to begin with but this latest entry reaches a new low point.",0
" If you're a Darin and/or a Spacey fan, this film is a must see. It's just that where I'm supposed to enthusiastically applaud, I find myself sitting on my hands.",1
" While the book works fine for the younger set, the film tries to be too much an Alice-in-Wonderland-class story for all ages, but it rarely works for both young and old at the same time.",0
" The movie finds some melancholy poetry in principal character Manglehorn's obsession with a long-lost love. But his decades-in-the-making redemption is too little, too late, for himself and the audience. ",0
 The suck principle is making up for lost time. It's almost bad enough to implicate its predecessors.,0
 The middle hour takes such a laughless nosedive that you'll wish they just cut out that 60 minutes and slapped the remaining 30 on TV.,0
" Shannon's intense here, as he is in many of his roles, but it's Jessica Chastain who really promotes the film's anxiety...",1
" There is next to no dialogue in the film's final 30 minutes %u2013 just a torrent of killing, blood and violence. The film's target market of young testosterone-charged males will no doubt be eager to immerse themselves in this blood-fest of stunts and sp",0
 Structurally inert.,0
" Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired.",0
" It's hard to imagine anybody who's 21 and over truly getting much out of 21 & Over, but as far as these sorts of films go, this one isn't as aggressively stupid as some.",0
" Nichols' wild narrative tributaries all eventually intersect, and at no time does he let one's attention stall.",1

 You could think of admission to Drawing Restraint 9 as an $8.25 nap.,0
 It has no thrills. No sense of real danger. No sense of loss at the deaths of the crewmen. It's as if Howard thought the sight of CGI whales leaping into the air would be sufficiently dramatic to carry the story.,0
 It is to the film-maker's credit that these scenes are filled with real tension and edge-of-your-seat moments.,1
 Who knew cold-blooded sociopaths were such softies at heart?,0
 Blomkamp's seemingly limitless imagination in terms of tech finds itself repeatedly and frustratingly grounded by heavy-handed storytelling.,0

" On the whole, though, Alice is such a wet character, and her plight so shallow and insignificant, it is a struggle to care. Stay, go, cry, laugh, wake me when it is over.",0
" While Attack On Titan is a strange cinematic beast to behold, especially for those unfamiliar with the anime, it is still an essential example of Japanese pop-culture loaded with thematic intrigue and audacious visuals.",1
" The kind of sappy, sadness-turns- to-gladness holiday movie that shows up on cable TV this time of year.",0
" As a whole, I cannot recommend Wolfman's Got Nards enough for those who love The Monster Squad, for fans of the horror genre, or even for anyone who has ever felt misunderstood by the world at large. ",1
 The work of a born filmmaker.,1
" Entirely hollow, poorly put together, and will require an audience on its level of stupidity to survive. Don't be one of its supporters.",0
" A film that fails to create any type of empathy with the spectator, especially in a time when TV does a better work at showing us a stronger version of the real world. [Full review in Spanish[",0
" [Glen] Hassard and [Marketa] Irglova, newcomers to feature film, show both natural acting skills and terrific musical ability.",0
 familiarity only adds to the feeling that this is just another Carrey movie,0

" The ensemble can't bring enough, though, to overcome the unoriginal setup and predictable story arc.",0
 Vardalos doesn't help her case by making her big screen comeback in something so sitcom-level.,0
" It's a hodgepodge; a love story, a heist movie, social satire. Yet none of them work. The love story is creepy at times. The heist isn't that exciting and has very low stakes. And the social satire has no bite.",0
 Tatou still inhabits the role of an annoying woman but the Rashomon feature affords heft for this film.,1
" Where are the scenes of the undead feasting on entrails? The atmosphere of creeping dread? The subversive satire? But take Forster's movie on its own terms and it delivers pulse-pounding, adrenaline-pumping excitement.",1
" What could have been a good black comedy ends up failing, with formulaic and didactic representations of immigrants as beings worth of holiness, stripped of complexity. [Full Review in Spanish] ",0
" Unforgettable simply fails to deliver in terms of atmosphere and, moreover, the filmmakers fail to develop any sort of subtext from the material that might give weight to the story.",0
" As the basis for a movie, it makes for a moving love story; but it doesn't really make much sense of two messy, complicated true lives.",0
" We're left with Mafiosi and l'amour fou, neither of which is as compelling as a mother's love.",0
" Gerwig pulls off an incredible trick: Somehow, she makes an inherently unlikable character, likable. It's one of the year's most intriguing and unmissable performances, and it confirms that Gerwig is among the brightest talents on the cinema scene.",1
 I can't say Everyone's Hero strikes out -- it might distract little kids for a while -- but the directors needn't bother practicing their home run trots.,0
" Long before the movie ends, it slips right off the sprockets.",0
" The first one offered the novel sight of Oskar Schindler going Commando. Unfortunately, this half-hearted sequel is low on novelty and lower on fun.",0
" For every moment the screenplay by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson gets right, there are two more to make you cringe in embarrassment.",0
 Zinnemann proved to be a filmmaker for all seasons.,1
 It's painful to think that a high school crowd might actually flock to this irresponsible goofball comedy.,0

 A new millennium hybrid of Dangerous Minds and Hoosiers.,0
" As a certain tenacious rocker once intoned, you barely passed the test, Jack. You know what you got? F plus. Click.",0
" Chayefsky was apparently serious about much of this shrill, self-important 1976 satire about television, interlaced with bile about radicals and pushy career women, and so were some critics at the time.",0
" Stallone's here, kind of, but ""Escape Plan 2"" doesn't have much interest in his participation, going the easy-peasy B-movie route to cough up an inexpensive, easily marketable sequel that's led by actor Xiaoming Huang.",0
" As a TV-to-movie remake, LOTL ranks with Lost In Space: fitfully entertaining, largely uninspired. Ferrell does his best, but ends up stranded in the middle of an ideas desert.",0
" Zwigoff captures quite well the backstab aspects of this world, its rampant phoney baloneyness. But his funk doesn't allow him to capture something far more enticing: the power of true artistry.",0
" It's an intriguing, then bemusing, sometimes unintentionally amusing blend.",0
 Swimming Pool smolders with held-back eroticism and brain-teasing enigmas.,1
" The first half of the film is dreadfully contrived and artificial, from the uneven acting to the stereotype-filled script, to the aforementioned set and production design.",0
 Fantastic Mr. Fox is indeed fantastic in every way.,1
 What makes us laugh at this dark comedy is the insolence its creators hold for the very bones of their narrative.,1
" Sandi Tan's view of what the original Shirkers represented, and what her new film should be, proves surprisingly expansive.",1
 Mediocre family fare that's simply not that much fun.,0
" This great poem on the end of the world is truly a film for the ages. It can't really be described, but only lived.",1
" Whatever its basis in fact, there's nothing to Young Goethe In Love's story that dozens of other films haven't done before, and better.",0
" This disappointing drama packs in too many characters, too many talky scenes, too many flashbacks.",0
 The Open Door as a perfect example of how not to make a horror film...,0
" 'The Reconstruction,' which clocks in at 2 hours, 43 minutes, with not a single extraneous frame, elevates the work from a robust genre film to a full-blown epic.",1
" It's the type of experience that you will never cry at in the theater, but will cry at long after, as the message fully sinks in.",1
 Despite the impressive dance sequences Love Tomorrow is lead-footed when it comes to drama and ultimately falls flat on its face.,0
 These women are so boring it's offensive. It's offensive to imagine two men trying so ardently and so poorly to guess how young women speak and behave. ,0
" It's all very personal and confessional, but it lacks an entry point for outsiders, with Hong's weirdness and structural mischief missing its mark unless one is immersed in the details of the director's life.",0
" Anyone who has seen a chick flick knows what is going to happen next, and next, and next...",0
" Aggressively, painfully quirky...",0
" Note By Note: The Making of Steinway L1307 doesn't need any cameos by celebrities, musical or otherwise, to hold our interest.",1
" ""The Darkness"" is a mostly lame, decidedly tame supernatural horror movie starring actors far better than the project at hand. And, who the f*ck is Jenny?",0

 A paean to death by bat droppings mixed with a bit of pork.,1
 Wildly overproduced and derivative.,0
 Not up to the inspired example of its classic inspiration.,0
 The most striking thing about Nuremberg is how it manages to be frankly didactic (note the subtitle) without ever at all feeling didactic.,1
" Artful, intelligent and wilfully obtuse, Cronenberg uses his skill to hold our interest through this oddity of a film.",1
" There is a rote quality to Solo: A Star Wars Story that not only undercuts many of these thrills, but runs directly counter to the spirit of Han Solo.",0
" November is all-caps CRAZY in the best, funniest, most exhilarating way possible. A mere description cannot, I recognize, do its out-there-ness true justice. ",1
" There's little in Billy Shebar's script, the rambling direction by theater and opera helmer Chen Shi-Zheng - or Liu Ye's impassive performance as the student.",0
" None of this compensates for the overfamiliar plotline, the underdeveloped side characters, the breakbeat soundtrack, the boring shootouts and a general air of overbaked silliness. But it helps.",0
 This is easily one of the worst films I've ever had to review.,0
" Johnny Ma's Old Stone is a lean, nasty entry in a subgenre that could be termed the bureaucratic noir.",1
" Moore and Lloyd posed this paradigm in a Cold War era and it never came to pass. Leave it to the Wachowski Brothers to update it for the War on Terror, or rather its aftermath.",1
" In a movie full of affection, Sonia Braga offers what's probably the best performance of her rich carreer. [Full review in Portuguese.]",1
" Grace Lee may not have the world's most unique name, but she has created an enjoyable documentary that will not soon be forgotten.",1

" Zack Snyder only forgot two things -- make us care, and slightly explain yourself. ",0
 You have to applaud the work by director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwritter Emma Donoghe in creating believable characters with honest emotions to allow a balance with the extraordinary circumstances they're put in. [Full review in Spanish],1
" C'mon, Harmony. Mano a boyo. What are you really trying to prove here?",0
" Cooper is like the Guy Fieri recipe for Anthony Bourdain: an enticing surface with no substance, much like the movie itself. ",0
" It is a nice autumn surprise to watch an old-school whodunit amidst superhero extravaganzas, but it often falls victim to its own excess.",0
 Probably the most entertaining film ever based on a soft drink commercial.,1
" The running time of 146 minutes takes too much wind out of Aibileen's sails, but her tear-jerking dignity in the denouement is marvellous to behold.",1
" Beckinsale's as much vamp as vampire, and that she's clad in tight shiny leather doesn't at all hurt her contribution to the cachet of the action drama.",1
" It seems, from the flat-out filmic disaster of ""Tideland,"" that director Terry Gilliam is intent on ensuring a decisive end to his checkered filmmaking career.",0
" The Damned United beautifully demonstrates that, if you pair a truly gifted screenwriter with terrific actors, cinematic magic is possible, perhaps even likely.",1
 What a spectacular way to ruin a great character. [Full review in Spanish],0
" Although sprinkled with some good scenes, The Night Before falls short of bridging the gap between adult humor and family Christmas comedies.",0
" The characters, storytelling and animation reach Pixar-level of greatness and ""Guardians"" is the best action/animated film since ""The Incredibles.""",1
" While Man on Wire remains the better telling of Philippe Petit's story, Robert Zemeckis' The Walk is a fine adaptation of these events, culminating with one of the most breathtaking climaxes of the year.",1
" At its core, 'Arctic' is not so much about survival, but the way our connection to others can allow us to push back against hopelessness.",1
" [Achieves] level of visceral intensity that rivals the jacked-up, heart-in-mouth tension that was previously the preserve of the best fiction film-makers.",1
" It's an unabashed feel-good weeper, and those eager for that type of fare might as well settle for this one. But an equal number will be put off by the bad dialogue, transparent manipulation and saccharine overkill.",0
" You may feel like you need a drink and a shower when you come out of Naked, but at least you'll know you've been somewhere new.",1
" What works about Lawless may get audiences buzzed, but they'll never feel thrillingly soused.",1
 This is the kind of empty film that usually plays on airline flights.,0
" Well-meaning, but ultimately flawed.",0
" There are a few hilarious scenes but no character we care about, making this remake inferior to Elaine May's 1972 film.",0
 This brilliantly acted film is another home run for The Brothers Duplass; life affirming and sure to put a spring in your step.,1
" Sinister, scary, imaginative and original - despite a thin, one-dimensional storyline.",1
" The dreamlike imagery, editing, and soundtrack invoke the haze of addiction, but the writing never follows through with the message, leaving us unstirred, with little to take home and think about.",1
" A lazy comedy, innocuous and inoffensive but formulaic and tired, as well as fatally overlong.",0
 A bland rom-com that seems afraid of its own subject matter.,0
" This is what some summer movies should be like - clever in a stupid way, and stupid in a clever way.",1
" When it comes down to it, this a movie where the only major female characters are intentionally interchangeable and exist only to castrate men.",0
 Wrath of the Titans delivers blockbuster bluster with single-minded blandness.,0
" Rockwell, who literally dances his way through battle scenes with guns and knives, hasn't had a role this satisfying in years.",1

" A strained, relentless quest for gross-out humor and outlandish sexual escapades.",0
" The Road possesses undeniable sweep and a grim kind of grandeur, but it ultimately plays like a zombie movie with literary pretensions.",0
" [It's] unlikely to be the flavour-of-the-week critic's pet that the original was, but it's a rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor in every respect.",1
" Still searching for their ""Holy Grail,"" this spotty entry contains few skits comparable to any of the clever comedy sketches of even Python's ""The Meaning of Life."" The laughs in ""Super Troopers 2"" are heavily labored and low brow.",1
 ...feels simplistically manufactured and manipulative...Caro is never able to elevate North Country beyond the pedestrian confines of a melancholy Lifetime TV movie,0
" While its discussions about supercomputers, transcendence and god complexes send red flags flying about the near future, the story's mainframe is faultily wired and in need of repair.",0
 The result is something that's hard to buy on almost every level.,0
" If you're in the mood to cheer the white hats, you'll probably like this film.",1
" It's original, sometimes moving and often surprising.",1

" With little fanfare, Robert Greenwald has become one of the most incisive activist filmmakers in America.",1
" If we look to cinema as a conduit for the entire range of the human experience, from its highest highs to its lowest lows, there's no denying that this movie is essential.",1
" Woody Allen devotees might appreciate the piece as a fleeting glimpse into the bizarre personal life of its creator, but mainstream audiences should pay no mind.",0

 The whole thing feels like a product of desperation and creative exhaustion.,0
 Greta ... is a perfect metaphor for Twitter.,1
 Epic tale about religious freedom gets very bloody.,1
" Allen's self-directed criticism of nostalgia worshippers could still come off as hypocritical, but his inventive approach instead results in one of the most charming, funny, and genuinely likable films that he's made in years.",1

" An uninspired retread of a horror classic, this tries hard to justify its existence... and fails.",0
" Semi-Pro is the perfect name for this movie, because it feels like a half-baked comedy made by semi-professionals.",0
" After nearly two decades in front of the camera, Luna has learned a thing or two about how to work behind it as well.",1
 ...the damn thing doesn't do much more than go blindly about it's paces and is even boring at times.,0
" Just as he has done for cartoons, Family Guy mastermind Seth MacFarlane has made what could have been a children's story safe for raunch.",1
" Everett can over-ice the cake, but while his turn does skirt the fringes of hamminess, it is undeniably laced with sensitivity.",1
" Though it's not perfect, The Martian's illustration of a world united by space travel is almost Utopian.",1
" A documentary to make your blood boil -- if you love cars, cherish the environment, and scorn the power and privileges of oil companies. ",1
" This isn't your Adam Sandler watered down comedy. It's raunchy, vulgar, rude, mean-spirited, and funny as hell.",1
 It has the dubious honor of being the first Bond film that manages to be downright boring.,0

" Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.",1
" It's hard to imagine that the young Scorsese, a daring and innovative film stylist, would have settled for such a sodden and blandly archetypal treatment of such incendiary material.",0
" The film contributes little to what is already known about [Vincent Van Gogh], however, this impressionistic visual delight is something you don't often get from cinemas. [Full Review in Spanish] ",1
" Bollywood Hero is largely predictable, and when it isn't predictable, it's only because the characters act nonsensically.",0
 Its elements don't really cohere.,0
" Boring. That's how I'd describe the latest Pirates film. Apparently, live men tell leaden tales like this, overstuffed with subplots and uninteresting characters. I'd rather walk the plank than spend another two hours with Jack Sparrow and company.",0

 Amusingly bad horror flick,0
 It's Funny Girl in lingerie.,1
 Too slow and too shrill.,0
 The One's script is just awful -- from premise to storyline to dialogue.,0
" We are ... at the end, left with a bloody mess, emphasis on guts. No thank you.",0
" The Ruins is lumpish, static, and obvious. It's a gringos-go-home cautionary fright flick done in the spirit of a cheap '50s horror movie, except that it leaves you longing for the competence of grade-Z studio-system trash.",0

" Mills - who last gave the semi-autobiographical treatment to his dad in ""Beginners"" - draws on strong memories and a rich imagination to recreate Santa Barbara circa 1979 and its denizens.",1
" A dark and driven work, haunted by violence, cruelty and a sense of the tragically absurd.",1
 No one could ever think that a movie about giant robots could ever beat the past three Transformers films for sheer awfulness. Think again.,0
 My recommendation? Skip this movie and buy the soundtrack instead.,0
" I like Seth, you like Seth. We all like Seth. BADLY miscast, here. And so was the director. ",0
 There's a lot to admire in The Brave One. It just doesn't cut as deeply as it needs to.,0
" It's not the stuff of Shakespearean drama, and in fact is barely enough to squeeze a few tears out of audiences into sentimental fare.",0
" ""Dhoom 2"" had fun with the mechanics of crime and crime fighting. This movie can't be bothered.",0
" While it's full of arresting, indelible images, Mr. Lonely remains mostly on the level of abstraction. You get it but you don't always feel it.",0
 It's a very curious and contradictory affair: a dystopian sci-fi movie based on a Japanese manga series that is brutal one moment and plays like Disney's Pinocchio the next.,0
" Part of the charm, yes, is the goofiness of it all -- but the film would have been better if it were more cohesive, streamlined, and focused.",1
" An exhilarating piece of direction that begs the question, Robert Redford? This is the same man who's been content making the cinematic equivalent of reading the L.L. Bean catalog for his entire career, and now he's ready for a bare-knuckle brawl?",1
 You know a movie is in trouble when you spend most of its running time wondering why on Earth the director wanted to make it.,0
 Happy Feet is the kind of musical comedy that might have swept the world if MGM had been based in Antarctica instead of Culver City.,1
" It sort of falls apart when we're supposed to start caring who dies. It's well-meaning to try to make them dimensional characters, but they are monster fodder.",0
" Although Imagine Me & You (never much liked that song) tries to tap into a popular theme, we never believe that Rachel and Luce are the slightest bit interested in one another.",0
" A black-and-white salute to the French New Wave (the score is borrowed from Georges Delerue, composer of many a Truffaut and Godard film) that manages to be very much of this moment ...",1
 The film is held aloft by the loamy charm of Mark Rylance. ,1
" Unlike the Coens, the Wachowskis' private dreams have a grandiosity that demands huge budgets they can only justify by drawing huge audiences. How long can they keep getting money by making movies like this one?",0
 Rowling's flaws as a storyteller are much more evident in this film than in previous installments.,0
 Burnham has tapped into a byproduct of social-media-saturated adolescence that's often overlooked in favor of parental panic and worst-case-scenario horror stories.,1
" It's like Anything Can Happen Day on The Mickey Mouse Club, but with a higher body count.",1
" There's a hell of a lot of stuff, everywhere, all the time, and the sheer energy of it all is contagious, propulsive, and fun ... the colourful direction, performances and design make for an engaging and relentlessly entertaining ninety-six minutes.",1
 You start to wonder what would happen if someone sprayed some Vapoorizer on the screen.,0
" A brilliant, often brutal biopic that's cool for cats of any persuasion, whether jazz fans or otherwise.",1
" The film O Brother, Where Art Thou? is unlikely to restore them to the ranks of the mainstream, but it reaffirms their status as first-class jesters of the fringe.",1
 ... legitimate thrills and chills with minimal bloodshed and only suggested violence.,1
 Intricate and moving drama about life's struggles and near misses.,1
" Frustrating but fascinating, with moments that refuse to be shrugged off",1
" Standard issue little-old-lady tour de force for Oscar winner Judi Dench, but a delicious change of pace for cynical, snarky funnyman Steve Coogan.",1
 It's a true powerhouse performance as Cummings shows his uncanny ability to traverse the delicate roads of a public nervous breakdown with pathos and humor.,1
" Making the transition from long-arc TV series to 100-minute feature film is no simple matter, but they've accomplished it with some skill here.",1
" Grease 2 is a bad movie that really doesn't deserve much of a defense. There are moments in it that are so cringeworthy, one might think they were the reason fast-forward buttons were included on VCRs.",0
 Interesting novelty is not enough to help this by the numbers sports biopic go the distance.,0
" Given its unusual blend of fact and fiction, the film is a real head-scratcher. Like most -- if not all -- of Maddin's films, it's as bewildering as it is visually arresting. And yes, that means it's an acquired taste.",0
" If some incarnation of ""Glee"" were to be developed for the Christian Broadcasting Network, it would probably look a lot like ""Joyful Noise.""",0
" The Canyons is no style and no substance, an exercise in poor judgement and stunt casting gone horribly wrong.",0
 Some scenes are downright insulting to viewers over the age of ten.,0
" Lazy filmmaking undermines this sparky caper thriller, from paper-thin characters and convenient plot points to limp direction and corny editing. This is a real shame, because the bright rising-star cast brings real energy to the weak material.",0
" While the film manages to drag the actual attack out to 45 minutes of its ponderous 183 minute running time, that still leaves a lot of movie to be taken up by what passes for plot -- a convoluted romance of the heavily cliched kind.",0
 The lack of empathetic characters seems more a filmmaking deficiency than some grand cinematic plan. The viewer definitely leaves the movie feeling unsatisfied.,0
" The filmmakers are lucky penguins are cute. A movie about a family of, say, warthogs is unlikely to engender the same reactions.",1
" A lavish, lascivious, elegant and enjoyable entertainment.",1
" [Eventually,"" Red Sparrow becomes a well-paced if not entirely engaging tale of international espionage, with the requisite number of plot twists.",1
" Dour, slow, and with little to stimulate the mind or the emotions, Sherlock Holmes is a big bust.",0
" Mostly, the minutes stretch into great expanses of blahness, much of them filled with Transformers-grade skyscraper snapping and bloodless catastrophe.",0
 Moore tries hard to be tough and cool in the Connery manner. ...he comes off pretentious and cold.,0
 A comedy fatally short on laughs.,0
" ...a bit like a poor man's Four Weddings and a Funeral... Although there are a few laughs and the slick script is peppered with juicy one-liners, it's mild and rather mannered as we fail to connect with the characters when it really matters.",0
" The new stuff is dull and forgettable, while the oldies are dismissed after a few bars before we can even start tapping our feet, as if writer-director Garth Jennings can't wait to get on to the next pointless scene. And at 108 minutes, it's far too long.",0
" The 88th Academy Awards (R) ceremony airs on Sunday, February 28, 2016...now you have another way to get ready.",1
 There's enough potential here to suggest a sequel isn't the worst idea provided Abbess and Cachia learn from their mistakes.,0
 A sweet and harmless comedy with a clear agenda behind it. [Full review in Spanish],0
" Save for Dakota Fanning (who is marvelous no matter the role), there isn't a whole lot to enjoy or get involved in.",0
" The premise -- someone trying to inject meaning into a necessarily vacuous existence -- is depressing, but there are moments of vaguely uncomfortable hilarity. The whole endeavor, however, winds up feeling flat and a bit dull.",0
" You have to be willing to accept a lot of nonsense if you're going to make it through Honeyglue, beginning with the title.",0
" Brawny but brainless, Pearl Harbor is another bloated, irresponsible example of history according to Disney-a lame juggernaut that falsifies the facts, assaults the senses and leaves you blind, deaf and soulless.",0
" A casually racist murder-mystery (minus the mystery) that was rejected by both audiences and critics due to a chaotic tone, insipid comedy beats and clunky action scenes set to slap-bass and scat-singing.",0
 The scariest thing about Annabelle is that a film studio would release such a lazy attempt at making a horror movie without any sign of shame.,0
" If you're the type of person given to eye-rolling, you'll probably do so here. And yet, despite some rough patches, the movie's pure charm often prevails.",1
" As Carrey's celebrated rubber does its patented act, the flick turns into a gyrational marathon -- mildly funny but seriously exhausting.",0
 The thudding sounds you hear at New In Town are jokes landing like lead balloons and conking the life out of the actors.,0
" The new film... is nothing if not a tribute to old-fashioned virtues, of care and craft and modesty, of simple stories well told.",1
" ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.",0
 The film's horrifying experience looms over each well-constructed frame without anywhere to go...,0
" Mr. Martin, it's perfectly all right to be serious and distinguished and write plays about Picasso, Einstein and bunny rabbits. You don't have to always be the wild and crazy guy!",0
" The Predator begins its new life merging Iron Man, comedy and the most essential puzzle piece - an ""on the spectrum"" kid. What's next? ""Xenomorph XX121"" speaking English with a British accent? Be afraid, be very afraid, it's coming.",0
" It's a flagrantly movie-ish concoction. But like Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies,"" it's been made with a so-old-it's-new classicism that is executed with enough flair to lure audiences in.",1
" A generic thriller with a generic title, Deception is so predictable you could guess what happens even if the trailer hadn't already given away just about every important plot development.",0
" A fast-paced adrenaline shot to the heart that shows the underbelly of the streets of L.A., but somehow, along the film's journey, it becomes strangely endearing and quite lovable.",1
 A colorful yet empty Big Top to house yet another collection of circus oddities that are presided over by one of Depp's traditional ringleaders.,0

 Michael Douglas clearly enjoys himself while Evan Rachel Wood looks appropriately exasperated throughout King of California. My sympathies were with her.,0
" Brexit is nicely ambiguous as to whether Cummings is a misguided genius or simply a talented opportunist, and Cumberbatch is excellent at conveying the lonely monomania of a man stubbornly devoted to principles that only he recognizes.",1
" An overdone finale aside, there's much to enjoy and admire in 10 Cloverfield Lane, from its sharp performances to its economical, acutely realized sense of scale.",1
" The sensual photography, music and locations are so entrancing ... they help the viewer to overlook the weak storyline, which prefers psychological ambiguity to solid police work.",1
" This cautionary tale about science without boundaries goes to such lengths to ""cross the line"" narratively that it leaves the big questions behind.",0
" The jokes in the movie are just as dumb as the ones in the trailer, but what doesn't come across in a two-minute preview is just how many there are. It's an avalanche of dirty puns, and what it lacks in ingenuity it makes up for, almost, in sheer volume.",1
 The Triplets of Belleville can feel so alive you may have trouble sitting still while watching it.,1

" You know where the thing is headed. Still, it's fun to watch.",1
 Don Jon isn't just a good effort from a first-time director. It's a pretty good film on its own too.,1
 A wonderfully made thriller that satisfies on every level. And I'm betting it will prove even more enjoyable upon repeated viewings.,1
" The jokes are, on paper, funny. On screen they just seem like the inevitable, the only thing to say, and their zing zags off into bland, familiar territory... the material didn't coalesce past pointing at something funny and saying, ""hey, that's funny al",0

 Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond is blandness personified.,0

" Soderbergh uses the mechanics of the grimy doll factory ... as metaphor, carefully tracking the shiny distractions we hide behind, revealing the awful little facts about their glued-on eyelashes and the identically blank faces they all start out with.",1
 This is an excruciating dramedy of schadenfruede for the anything-goes hipness of the last decade and a half which has devalued contentment as a cop out,1

" But with a game supporting cast including Ewan Bremner and Octavia Spencer, well-paced direction, superb cinematography, plus a gripping adventure story to boot, Snowpiercer rolls along at super speed, making any complaining seem like nitpicking. ",1
" The film is a treat to behold whenever it dives into the ocean as Wan embraces the absurdity at every turn, wearing the inherent goofiness as a badge of honour.",1
" ... what winds up in the picture's largely lazy grasp is largely evidence of the influence of, well, any number of cheap and often straight-to-video testosterone fests.",0
" "" 'Deepwater' certainly is not awful, but you can't get more mainstream -- or predictable -- than this Peter Berg telling of what caused the big rig explosion behind the largest oil spill in U.S. history.",1

 Now [Cohen is] turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel.,0
" The message appears simple: Women can be seduced by a killer, especially if he is a killer handyman.",0
 A truly absorbing and enjoyable film.,1
 One cannot help but wonder how far Cohen can take the offensiveness routine before audiences figure out he's a comedian with very few jokes.,0
 That an actor exec produced such a film is a sad commentary on where we stand in early-21st century filmmaking.,0

 What finally sells The Innkeepers is the fact that the payoff really pays off.,1

" With its taut action, relatively ambitious screenplay and a credibility-lending supporting turn from Ed Harris, Run All Night is actually a solid 97-minute thriller. Unfortunately, it runs 114 minutes.",0
" Despite the palpable air of deja vu that hangs over it like a light fog, The Devil Inside generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario.",1
 Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.,1
" Less satisfying overall than it could have been, it nonetheless boasts a sublime cynicism and just enough of a twinkle in its metaphorical eye to let most of us in on the joke",1
 Meet the Browns is lots of fun -- light on the Jesus-ifying and heavy on showcasing some very talented African-American performers whom audiences don't get to see often enough. You'll be glad to have been introduced.,1
" Hedlund's got a hell of a voice, rotgut-ragged, and whether he's crooning or wooing, whatever he's selling, and no matter how cornpone, I'm buying.",1
 The characters are emotionally neutered; the average viewer won't care about them. The pacing is plodding and uneven.,0
" Cold, shallow and preposterous . It's a squandered opportunity to tell a rich, engrossing and sophisticated character-driven story for adults. ",0

" Illumination Entertainment has dispensed with almost all of Dr Seuss' endearing dialogue, which is a shame, because the film could do with more of a personality of its own.",0
" Walker's strategy yields drama on par with a scripted thriller ... But what's missing, I think, is a moral sense.",0
" If you like the TV show, you'll like this, though you might feel it's a bit too much of a usually-good thing.",0

 One of 2009's finest motion pictures -- an open and honest look at sexual politics and a woman's place in the world during the early1960s.,1
 Greer is hilarious.,1
" There are some big laughs, but it lacks that final burst of inspiration to send it over the fences.",0
" This is a movie about a subculture, made for that subculture; only hard-core Xboxers need apply.",1
 A fresh take on the rom-com... quirky ironies layered through the story make it remarkably engaging.,1
" The split narrative allows filmmakers to jump to another storyline if one starts to languish. It's like a ""Monty Python"" episode: Don't know how to finish a sketch? Cut to something completely different.",1
 The rather clever concept is squandered in a low-rent action movie that really ends up being a waste of our time.,0
" While not as original as the first film, it's just as scary and scores points for cleverly tying the two stories together.",1
" [A] vomit-inducing blend of mawkish sentimentality and dead-on-arrival humour, all bundled up in a putrid package of festering family-friendly fun.",0
 Fuel up the Invisible Jet. You're in for a ride.,1

" There are some pretty tense moments, the plot does keep you guessing and the performances are effective, especially the somewhat enigmatic character played by Kidman.",1
" You may not buy the third-act developments, but Reichardt and her actors see to it that you believe in how these people got to that third act in the first place.",1
" Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has just about everything I look for in an animated feature: visual wit, high-flying displays of imagination and lots of rotting flesh.",1

 A sentimental yet sharply observed documentary about the rise and demise of retail giant Tower Records.,1
 Clooney tries to Flags of Our Fathers if directed by Preston Sturges.,0
 a functional film about an astounding person who faced the whirlwind and didn't blink,0
" an insular story, told by insiders, of a particular community - a community to which this reviewer happened to be connected ... invaluable as a reminder of how it felt to be helpless, to be thought lost, and yet prevail. They - we - did overcome. ",1
 It's loud and full of vim -- but a little hollow and heartless.,0
" The novelty of having many femmes in a genre that's largely male-driven, and the fact they are played by potentially appealing actresses as Mendes and Johansson, do not compensate for the narrative and technical shortcomings of Miller's solo debut.",0
 Cloverfield is visceral attack that it leaves the viewer reeling for details that flew by like so many bricks raining off broken buildings.,1
 There are moments that suggest the director might do something better next time.,0
" Commenting on the role of artists in society today, the strident dissertations would be worthy of a graduate-level art theory class if they weren't so maddeningly pretentious.",0

" One long action sequence that leaves you spent, rather than exhilarated.",0
" After a promising start, Bridget Jones's Baby gets more nonsensical as it goes, culminating in a ridiculous race to the hospital that should have embarrassed everyone involved.",0
" This has all the appeal of reheated, congealed blood.",0

" Basically Planes, Trains and Automobiles with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis, minus the earned sentiment and John Hughes cred.",0
" Michael Fassbender has screen presence and emotional acuity to die for but this prequel is all prologue, no payoff.",0
 Hanks's Sullenberger is by far Eastwood's most untarnished standard-bearer to date. Not even Nelson Mandela came off looking this good. ,1
 A tedious action caper that has only a handful of laughs and suffers from a dearth of storytelling magic. It's shockingly un-Pixar-like.,0
 Emma Stone has that certain something ensuring she'll be a big star... She's like Lindsay Lohan before the rap sheet; a fair comparison given Stone's striking red hair and a plot owing a lot to Mean Girls.,1

 The BFG casts a wondrous spell.,1
" Narrated by Patrick Stewart, this is beautifully shot if a tad toothless. Nothing to upset tots.",1
 I'm sure a lot of bad fiction has been written about veterans and current soldiers in the Iraq War. It's just not that often that it gets shot and projected on to a big screen.,0

 David Ayer is of the realist school of action filmmaking and this doesn't jibe well with fantastical fights and outrageous cartoon characters.,0

 The ultimate Looney Tunes.,1
 A Wrinkle in Time is simply a movie that doesn't work. It's not a disaster. It's not a film worthy of any ire. It's an underwhelming fantasy that fades from memory in no time at all.,0

" McAvoy's finest turn since Filth, is enough to turn this inane, absurd piece of cinema, into a rather good one.",1

 Transformers: The Last Knight is one of the dumbest action films of the year....,0

 Paraplegic hitmen in wheelchairs - that's the offbeat concept behind Hungarian writer/director Attila Till's movie.,1

" There are many ways to define the shrieking awfulness of The Family Stone, from the general lack of wit to the cheap exploitation of cancer to its casual cruelty.",0
 The movie finds a spiritedness in its characters so likeable that it's nearly impossible to take the misogynist conclusion seriously.,1

 The movie has a zippy script by Audrey Wells ... as well as a supersized order of funny supporting characters.,1
" Rather than exploring the voracious media culture that built Webb up and then tore him down, the film keeps the focus on the man himself. ",1
 One gets the impression that Jackson was enchanted by the idea of getting to create limbo as imagined by a 14-year-old girl (all verdant landscapes and pretend photo-shoots) but didn't know what to do with the rest of the movie.,0

" Gaudily filmed, tenderly imagined.",1
 This is exactly what you would expect - a perfect and exciting ending for those who have been following the franchise. Those who couldn't care less probably stopped reading ages ago. ,1
" Since this is the sort of film in which the children of the subject go through photo albums reminiscing about what they remember of their mother and their childhoods with her, don't approach Diana, Our Mother as a shocking-revelation documentary. ",1
" McLean orders up CGI phantoms and horrified looks, but little demands attention, going through the motions to keep up with the competition.",0

 Beast is rough around the edges but as a feature debut marks out its director as one of the most intriguing new talents in British filmmaking.,1

" A slapdash bit of entertainment, that may delight young children, but will surely bore--and possibly depress--their parents. ",0
" If Dugan's crude, occasionally effective effort ends up chipping away at America's moron class regarding gay rights, that'll be nice. But even unrepentant homophobes deserve funnier.",0
 Last Vegas simply lacks the excitement you'd hope for.,0

 An enjoyably slippery suspense thriller that tugs our sympathies this way and that while springing narrative twists and traps with stomach-lurching suddenness.,1
" In the end, Nocturnal Animals barely feels like a film made by a human being. You could just dub it a ""stylish exercise"" and call it a day. But I just can't shake the fact that Ford somehow wants it to be more.",0
" A misogynistic American teen gross-out comedy. Celebrating male promiscuity as a rite-of-passage while demonising girls for sleeping around, it never even attempts to punish its protagonists for their horn-dog ways.",0
 ...like a new sitcom with a great cast that's so badly conceived and executed it's yanked after two episodes. Only the genuine sweetness between Frost and Jones and McShane's wacky casting make this film remotely bearable.,0
 Year One is a slapdash film in desperate need of more authoritative stewardship.,0
" God Bless America is a modern-day parable... It's not always easy to watch, but it's got a lot to say. Just be prepared to have your worldview challenged.",1
" This is a movie that does not want you to think too much, lest you notice all its faults. It is a silly caper with the emphasis on action choreography and big set pieces -- which would be fine if the choreography and CGI were not so lacklustre.",0
" I set a personal record watching ""Rebel in the Rye."" I have never before hated a film this quickly and thoroughly. It took me about 2 minutes to despise the film and my feelings never really changed despite the fact that there are truly fine actors in it.",0
" Going to a scary movie is kind of like a first date. Your palms get sweaty, you're consistently nervous, and you're just hoping for something unexpected to happen. It's a love/hate thing, and so is this movie.",0
" A puerile, remedial class version of Wedding Crashers.",0
 The film is experimental in the way that the final product is much more of a labor-intensive challenge for the filmmakers than a cerebral one for audiences.,0
" Under the Tree is fairly lean, but not everything was clear in its necessity...finally some of it is hilarious (in a bad way).",0
" Though there are several truly funny moments in Big Daddy, they're all included in the trailer, so if you've seen it, that's all you need.",0
 Mostly succeeds on its own merits...[but] many comedic and musical distractions pad the 134-minute running time and stray from the implicit promise of that title: the film has little to say about middle age...,1
" Lee finds subtle and clever ways to link the narrative with the setting, allowing the gaping hole in the middle of Manhattan ... to become an all-encompassing metaphor for both the pains of life and hope",1
" The vocal work is so finely honed by the cast of regulars, that the acting conveys a timing and skill rarely encountered in even the best live-action comedies.",1
" As Coogan warns Brydon early on, ""It feels odd to do something for the second time."" Like all good advice, though, it falls on deaf ears.",0
" Coming from a director renowned as spartanly anti-dramatic, the film's escape is almost preternaturally gripping.",1
" Filiatrault has an ear for clever, amusing dialog",1
" Spector, who's a fluid, straightforward director, resists the crutch of music until the final scene when he goes and blows it all by playing something stupid like... a Gary Barlow song.",0

" Without doubt, this is one of the films of the year that everyone should see.",1
" New writers and directors for each installment have kept the creativity flowing, and like the ""Fast and Furious"" movies, the ""Mission: Impossible"" film series has hit its stride later in its run.",1
" Aggressively stupid and blissfully unaware of it, Stealth follows a robot plane on a journey of self-awareness.",0
" It's a raw, muscular movie with terrific work from Blunt and Del Toro, quietly debating urgent moral questions between stunning set pieces.",1
" You have to work a bit harder to put the pieces together and you're responsible for the answers, but the effort is paid back with an exhalation, a single expression on Kris' face and the recognition of it in your own.",1
" As the Bond series moved deeper into the 1970s, the emphasis moved away from the inventive scripts that made the best Sean Connery films fine examples of the spy genre and toward the kind of feats of daring and visual spectacle.",0
" Downrange certainly delivers and holds the attention, especially when the film moves into the second half towards a climactic and satisfying pay-off.",1
" Whether you like The Meg depends on how much you like seeing Jason Statham in and out of a wetsuit, doing action-hero things. He's certainly good at it, and he's the best thing about the movie, not that the competition is particularly fierce.",0
 The first film by a 26-year-old director (Gela Babluani) that feels like the worst of what a 26-year-old director could make.,0
" A talking cat and moon and a restless T-shirt distract from the story, creating what July intends as interesting textures but instead come across as a form of vandalism.",0

" Finally, an adventure film for grownups",1
" The kind of funny, exciting, entertaining action film that 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' was supposed to be.",1
" It's all watchable, but in the way of a rainy Saturday afternoon Law & Order marathon, even with Kruger wrestling to invest scenes of her snorting and free-basing her pain away with emotional authenticity.",0
 [A] bizarrely clenched and infantilised tragedy-twee heritage drama about AA Milne's fraught relationship with his son Christopher Robin.,0

 It's difficult to say which is worse--Allcroft's script or her direction.,0
 The barriers that divide text from subtext and meta-text are torn down in War for the Planet of the Apes; instead we get all of them at once in a pasteurized soup of signification.,0
 It's so hilariously inept that it's almost worth watching.,0
" I can safely say we could have lived life quite contently without ever seeing it, but it's hard to completely dismiss it. ",1
" This is a shrewdly contemporary-feeling story of female self-determination in a world of stultifying male privilege, though the sparkling script and dynamic performances never make it feel like propaganda or special pleading.",1
" It was totally unrelatable on almost every level, one of the worst sins that a romcom can commit.",0
" This is a great radio bit. Problem is that somebody decided this was a movie, and it is certainly not.",0
" An ambitious, beautiful but shallow alternative to typical summer fare.",0
" The doc's centerpiece - the series of debates, which escalated as the protests outside did the same - is giggly stuff. But it's the postscript that takes it to another level.",1
" In Bille August's Pelle the Conqueror, Max von Sydow is so astoundingly evocative that he makes your bones ache. This is a performance that comes from the joints and ligaments; it's conceived in marrow.",1
" This goofy, sporadically amusing satire is a career bounce-back of sorts. While [director Levinson] is not completely back on his game here, at least the film might make us forget about 2006's disastrous Man of the Year.",1
" By no means the perfect biopic, but one that covers a lot of ground in telling Amelia Earhart's story. The amount of research that went into (it) is fairly impressive.",1
" You can do a lot worse than the new Poltergeist film, but on every conceivable level you can do better by simply watching the original film again.",0
" There is no heart, there is no soul, instead there is only the coldly calculated mechanics of a familiar tale told far too many times before. As gatherings go, this is unfortunately one I'd rather have avoided.",0
" Crumb's sense of humor is his saving personal grace and the movie's insurance policy against total immersion into the morbid. But just so you know, Crumb fully earns its most revealing screen credit: 'David Lynch Presents.'",1
" Looks at the ugliness of the world, but attempts to ask why it's that way.",1
" Malick seeks only to gorge on the emotional malcontent of his disaffected players. They don't seek transcendence from their lot, just pity in finding the right partner.",0
" Nowhere near as good as its reputation. A cheesy mess, supported only by its nostalgia.",1

" A nightmare for those who like things served easy -- but if you relish off-the-deep-end bravado, its pleasures are boundless.",1
" Eighth Grade is one of the most thoughtful and nuanced films made about the teenage experience, an authentic story of angst, anxiety and confusion - in other words, what it's like to be 13 years old.",1

 Its most emotionally charged moments buckle under the weight of a ceaseless and manipulative score.,0
" Though technically up to snuff, it's flat-footed stuff.",0
" Director Arcel handles the material with a stately grace that compensates for the story's predictable trajectory, though humdrum period detail and monotonous pacing too often leave the proceedings feeling only partially aroused.",0
" It is relentless, horrifying, and skilfully implies the endless carnage going on in the background while driving forward a simple but powerful narrative which proves that, even in hell, you never stop being a parent.",1
" The obviousness of the message -- follow the right leader -- would be more tolerable in a less badly acted, less shoddy-looking film.",0
" Nice, but lacks the substance it needs to make us feel as good as it wants us to.",0
" This film is a total drag to watch. It is slow. It is dark. It is depressing, and it seems as though it is never going to end. It is torture to sit through this film. It runs 144 minutes and seems twice that long.",0
" It is a layered, witty, enlightening assault on conventions and preconceptions, a crackling palimpsest that challenges as it entertains.",1
" By rights, a superhero sequel should be darker, more intense and more dangerous, but Favreau is happy just to stay cool. That's all Iron Man's job has ever been, and frankly, that's fine by me. ",1
 the girl's ungainly snout is the only unique feature in this otherwise textbook fantasy.,0
 The need to cram in facts and events makes 'Machine Gun Preacher' feel too much like one large and needlessly glossy montage sequence.,0
" The story arc from his diagnosis to his death doesn't cover much ground in Romain's life. But his emotional landscape -- the conflicts, the anger, the sadness, the acceptance -- offers much more depth.",1
" There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's all neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on.",0
" It is safe to say that few heard about this incident and wondered what kind of gelato these guys prefer, or what they talk about when connecting on Skype.",0
 Story-less tale of depression isn't helped by 3D cinematography,0
" A pretty good thriller, with three Oscar winners doing good work, especially Pacino.",1
 Just ask someone you know to put a sheet over their head and suddenly run at you. It's far cheaper and much more memorable than the grainy gimmick being pushed by The Ghost Dimension.,0
" If Ms. Dieckmann really thinks that people communicate as inanely as she has written this script, then we are all doomed.",0
" The stone-faced, determined Doupe and the charismatic, self-destructive Devaney are fascinating to watch as they symbolically - and then literally - spar. And the landscape has a rugged, unsentimental beauty.",1
" Eventually ""The Beguiled"" shifts into a horror show/thriller with at least two major ironies that will resonate long after you leave the theater. ",1
 Kid-centric but violent prequel lacks energy of originals.,0
" For all its many little foibles, X-Men: First Class, is surprisingly well-handled and directed; surging forth with the drama and intensity of a global-looming threat.",1
 Star Joel Murray is SO good and Bobcat finds the sharp edge of his satirical gift often enough to warrant a look. ,1
" [A] trite, manipulative, excruciating nightmare of female pyschosis and idiocy presented as feminine adorableness.",0
 This clunky TV remake is stiffer than an iron curtain.,0
 Think of Tom Cruise as a more intense and less charming Wall-E. ,0
" Adults in their 40's today should find the film very satisfying. However, the jokes and sight gags arrive in such machine-gun fashion that young kids and many adults will be hard pressed to keep pace. ",1
" Incredibly, this screen adaptation is rated PG-13, which means that parents, who will probably find it excruciatingly simpleminded, are cautioned to keep it away from their middle school children, the only viewers who might possibly enjoy it.",0
 The script tries to be funny but simply falls flat. And the premise the tale is built on is somewhat bizarre.,0
" Borrowing liberally from the spirit of famed countryman Federico Fellini's 1960 classic La Dolce Vita, Sorrentino emerges with an existential fantasy steeped in Italy's rich cinematic history, with feet firmly planted in the present.",1

" The results are mistimed and misshapen, like Lubitsch after a vasectomy",0
" A Midnight Clear is a beautifully written, directed and acted movie, but it is so gut-wrenching, so taut, that it is more catharsis than entertainment.",1
" Awards season is coming and ""Boy Erased"" has easily put itself in the running for some end of the year gold. ",1
 This is more an exercise in suspense than one of logic. And it satisfies neither suspense nor logic.,0
" It's not without its charms and you could certainly do worse, but don't expect too much from The Super.",0
" The premise of Reign of Fire is an exciting one that, ultimately, does not translate into an exciting film.",0
" A classy drama and a sympathetic portrait of two outsiders and the vibrant, unsettling work that binds them.",1
" Any similarity to that quirky, hilarious, raunchy and imaginative Albert Finney vehicle from 1963 ('Tom Jones') is purely in the mind of the filmmakers.",0
" What's unclear at the end, unfortunately, is why Soderbergh really bothered with this one.",0
" Think of it as a fairytale only with more of a ... oh, who am I kidding? I can't defend this.",0
" While The House Bunny is sure to appeal more to the female demographic, at least the guys who get dragged into watching this particular chick flick by their dates can feel solace in knowing that it could be a whole lot worse.",0
" The result seems almost as hypocritical as many of the movie's targets, which ultimately defeats the movie's intentions.",0
" By the end, Helandar's movie feels more like an elaborate punchline to an overwrought joke, a thematic gibe more appropriate for a short film.",0
" However baffling his chosen topic, Almereyda's stylistic choices, brisk pace and comic tone make Experimenter a welcome shock.",1
" It's a welcome return for the studio who originated the iconic creature creation, but unfortunately, it never lives up to the drama of the 1954 original, or the bananas fun of all the B-Movie schlock that followed.",1
 A veteran documentarian's 40 years of charting the changing fortunes of Cuba and its people yields an informative and personal portrait of Castro's nation.,1

" It's comfort food for the holidays, easily digested and passed before the new year sets in and you resolve to swear off such rich and unhealthy edibles as this.",1
" Hysteria is a clever satire about the birth of the world's most popular sex toy, and despite some clunky rom-com plot devices it was refreshing to see a film subvert period film stuffiness with a barrage of vagina humour. ",1

" ""The Immigrant"" suffices as a theatrical experience, in the end, the appreciation for its visual and detailed nature are the only things that impress.",1
" Reese Witherspoon is such a skilled comedienne that it's a shame that people seem to prefer seeing her in films like Sweet Home Alabama, which are completely unworthy of her talents.",0
" It propels the viewer up, up and away in an experience combining smart, imaginative storytelling with dazzling dreamlike visuals, creating an experience that is the special province of animation -- at once utterly convincing and completely impossible.",1

 There's nothing to stand in the way of Mutiny qualifying for box office dynamite rating.,1
" The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core.",1
" A wilfully opaque, if undoubtedly pioneering, documentary from British-French husband-and-wife team Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel.",1
" It coasts to a standstill when they part company in the final act. Still, that only underlines the film's point. Neither of the men is a genius without the other man there beside him.",1

 This is not necessarily a film to love or hate though.,1
" Marvel's 'DareDevil' falters, fails to meet high expectations",0

" The result is a truly engrossing film, one of the year's best nonfiction portraits of the natural world.",1
" Crowd-pleasing and rousing, the movie's winning third final act will definitely render the picture as solid contender in awards season.",1
" The final, and anti-climactic, 'threequel' of the summer has nothing new to say. A staleness pervades the film, despite all efforts to inject freshness and excitement into a tired story.",0
" Disney has a lot to answer for, but its worst sin may be one of its oldest -- anthropomorphizing nature.",0

" This dumb, derivative teen slasher movie would be uninspiring coming from any writer-director, let alone one with several genre classics under his belt.",0

 It's the end of the world and it looks just fine.,1
" It's got a talented cast that manage to create a few powerful moments, but overall the film feels contrived and hollow. Unlike the book.",0
 Equal parts absurd and surprisingly wonderful.,1
 Few filmmakers have ever been as gifted at affirming the degree to which we are more alike than we may ever have thought possible.,1

 Loses the bits of comic fodder that make Pride and Prejudice and Zombies worth seeing.,0
" We rely on the actors and the script to convey the mood, and director George Cukor matched no less a figure than Alfred Hitchcock with the results.",1

" Laura Poitras teaches by example, providing a privileged insight into Edward Snowden's personality and motivation while keeping the focus on government spying.",1
" Writer-director Cynthia Mort focuses on Simone's late-career relationship with her nurse-turned-manager, and isn't able to branch out and grasp the story of Simone's art or her impact.",0
 He [Joe Nussbaum] pretty much directs by the numbers.,0
" Scary, campy and eventually quite moving, Maleficent is a frankly thrilling feminist fairy tale and completely engaging throughout.",1
" A tough little crime drama full of muted anger, growled dialogue and whispered threats...Much as we applaud the achievements of filmmakers working on small budgets, you can't hand out free passes when those limitations hobble the flow and feel of a film.",1
 The picture is slathered with so much CGI goop that it's often indistinguishable from a Saturday morning cartoon show. ,0
" The sexual politics have dated, yet conversely, Cuckoo's overlap with Michel Foucault's ideas on the construction and socio-political appropriation of madness remains potent and urgent.",1
 The movie does a pretty good job with period ambience. But it's a long haul waiting for the hero to keel over.,0
 Sitcom leftovers are artlessly reheated in this repetitive and exaggerated romantic comedy-drama about a newlywed couple.,0
" Fury reeks of self-importance, a strange arrogance for a fictional World War II drama... The movie wishes to be epic, a companion piece to Saving Private Ryan except Ayer only knows the first 15 minutes of Spielberg's movie, the bloodbath part.",0
" Seventh Son is thoroughly ill-conceived, a pale imitation of its more adventurous and breathtaking brethren.",0
" The awfulness of Atlas Shrugged continues a trend, since the cinema has never treated Rand very well.",0
" Remains one of cinema's glorious enigmas, endlessly compelling and intriguing.",1
 A masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.,1

 The play needs a gritty embrace and gets it. That and a flawlessly chosen cast.,1
" The classroom comedy ""Bad Teacher"" could have been sent to detention for copying off of ""Bad Santa,"" but it's brazenly funny in its own right - until it turns into a goody two-shoes.",1
" While not being the most awful filmic experience available, it's certainly one of the dumbest.",0
 An awkward horror pic.,0
 You're left feeling like you've been screamed at for 80-odd minutes.,0
 It works as a funny and slicker-than-expected parody of the genre.,1
" It's engaging enough, driving home the familiar message of following one's dreams and the less hackneyed theme of facing one's fears. But it feels far too familiar",0
 Push is this year's Jumper. 'Nuff said.,0
" It's more like a series of sentimental greeting cards suitable at differing stages of a relationship, from sparkling first love to broken relationship to marriage and out of it ... The screenplay is rather formless and for the most part, tedious. ",0
" A point of departure for Eastwood, Hollywood's most versatile and prolific director today, Hereafter suffers from narrative flaws (compromised ending), but it offers quite an intriguing meditation about fate and mortality, life and death.",1
" Toru Hosokawa's Golden Orchestra is that rare light, charming comedy that not only brings laughs, but will also resonate with audiences on a deeper, personal level.",1

 A handsome production. It plays the novel's beats with a special kind of dexterity.,1

 There is a lot that is contrived and does not work. The little things wrong with the film add up to too much.,1
 Almost everything about this movie looks and feels right.,1
" blending social commentary with spiritual allegory, it traces one man's nocturnal descent into the Circle of Hell that is Romania's healthcare service",1
 Pointless Pirates,0

" A bunch of strange, vague ideas crammed into a movie with nowhere to go and absolutely nothing to show us.",0
" Synecdoche, New York strives to be a work of greatness. But Kaufman's overarching vision is a lot less interesting than the small insights he gathers along the way.",0
 A wild ride during Prohibition,1
" Goldsman's directorial debut is decorated by an A-list cast (watch out for Will Smith, if you must), one can only assume that he has their families held hostage somewhere, because even by Colin Farrell standards, Goldsman's tale is a mawkish stinker.",0

 Penn's main idea about going native is making eye contact with a deer.,0
 ...reveals ... a supple and engaging actor with a sense of humor and a rare kind of self-recognition. Van Damme knows what we think of him and understands why.,1
 What's most wondrous about Moonlight is that it's an uncommonly small story that has so much going on. Beautiful filmmaking on every level (Splice Today) ,1

" Despite Hopkins' balmy performance, this scare picture is too serious by half. In place of supernatural hocus-pocus we get artsy-fartsy set design, hoof prints in the snow.",0

" For those of us who agree with Mel Brooks that ""there's something about this middle-aged bald guy that's thrilling,"" his new film is a high-spirited treat - and a hint at the possibilities that await him if and when he finally calls it a day on 'Curb.'",1
 Surrogates is a compelling set-up buttressed by slick effects and impressive production values that ultimately proves to be as hollow and superficial as the technology it conjures.,0

 Nothing in the movie is funny -- aside from giggles provoked by misfired jokes -- or romantic or dramatic.,0
" The real talent behind Gunpowder & Sky's film is its trailer cutter, who has made a marginal comedy look side splitting. There are some initial laughs, but the cast probably had more fun making this than you will watching it.",0

 It's Gleeson who turns McDonagh's self-conscious erudition and defense-mechanism irreverence into something transcendent.,1
" Sadly, the only wonder about this messy, overstuffed film, is the bewilderment of seeing so many talented people attached.",0

" Takes a rather simple, mostly predictable and small story and manages to turn it into something quite good and, to keep with the cooking symbolism, meaty.",1
" Even in black and white, there is little contrast, no edge, no dagger of meaning, it's just a bunch of great actors getting all dressed up and putting on a show for those seeking romantic solace, and an earful of old words with a hint of wisdom.",0
" Darkly humorous at times and deeply somber at others, Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter is an ambitious film that feels no need to over tell their chosen story. ",1
" Immortality, justice and integrity are the themes of this high energy action fantasy effectively set on a Japanese backdrop, in which Hugh Jackman's buffer-than-buff Wolverine is both heroic and vulnerable",1

" Pitching the film playfully between farce, with a knowing satiric edge, high action and high romance, Dark Shadows is a lot of fun.",1
" Stronger direction, better performances and a story that actually feels like it is headed somewhere special. Catching Fire more than lives up to the sky-high hype.",1
 The Purge is mostly a genre picture trying to layer on some prestige by way of social commentary. The latter falls flat; the film is actually stronger when it just goes for our baser instincts.,1

" Berger plays Blancanieves like a game, very carefully monitoring the mood and heightening it or lowering it as needs be.",1
" Stick It is shrill, unrepentantly lame and will surely disappoint any fan of gymnastics as Bendinger substitutes some kind of Olympic-sized political statement in place of a big, rousing finale.",0

 Overexposed and underdeveloped.,0
" ""Sorority Row"" is so completely (and thankfully) forgettable that you will be hard-pressed to remember much of it by the time you hit the parking lot",0
" It feels increasingly like a symbol of traveler abroad alienation-what trying to live in a place that isn't home can feel like: confusing, rageful, even physically debilitating.",1

 The film tries to say something coherent about important issues such as the descending darkness of old age but misses the mark with most of them.,0
" Plays more like a celebration than an examination, emphasizing hagiography over history.",0
" Comes off as a hollow masquerade, play-acting at machismo for nearly two hours. Along with the furniture tossed in fits of rage, there are empty flourishes of neo-noir style, rote action sequences, and little danger for our hardboiled heroes.",0
" A museum tour of past thrills... At this point even the thrill kills have lost their shiver, objectively less frightening than a bucket of fried chicken parts.",0
 Bateman and McCarthy elevate the material to a higher level than it should have.,1

 ...wildly entertaining...,1
 A braver movie would have seen the couple's standoff through to its logical conclusion -- the eventual insistence on happily ever after seems more than a little weaselly.,0
" Despite some scattered big laughs from this collection of insufferable characters, we too often laugh at them rather than with them, and the tedious film ultimately suffocates from its quirks.",0
 Writer Bradley Allenstein peppers the script with a lot of lame locker-room jokes that appear on the horizon long before they hit the screen.,0
" At times, however, Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow, or care about.",0
 ...showoff filmmaking that blatantly ignores the needs of story and character in favor of whatever happens to look 'cool.',0
" Invictus remains inspiring and educational, especially during this present time in America in which we are supposedly muddling our way into a post-racial society.",1

" ""The Grace Card"" is a Christian drama about a racist cop and his gospel-preaching partner who . . . hey, wait a second. Where are you going?",0
 Just ask someone you know to put a sheet over their head and suddenly run at you. It's far cheaper and much more memorable than the grainy gimmick being pushed by The Ghost Dimension.,0
" Paloschi's tight direction and crisp pace further elevate the film, turning what most would assume to be a sob story into a triumphant chronicle that never slips into sentimentality.",1
" That everything should go wrong is no surprise, but the wrong turns are taken so viciously -- Gershon, in particular, is appallingly treated, in closeup -- that they lead the film, adapted from the play by Tracy Letts, to the brink of abusive farce.",0
" Sadistic, slow-footed and inferior copy of a top notch Norwegian comic thriller.",0
" A paradoxically angry crowd-pleaser drawn in broad emotional strokes, The Hate U Give is an exemplary post-Black Lives Matter story of political consciousness-raising.",1

 Romantic comedy involving a heist has cursing. ,1

 Inferno is a two-hour travelogue that ultimately goes nowhere.,0
" In the tradition of William Friedkin's The Exorcist, this chilling low-budget horror movie taps into the same temporal fear that sparks religious feeling.",1

" Watchable Disney adventure in the classic tradition -- it features some impressive visuals and a strong vocal cast, but lacks the necessary kick to put it up there with Disney's best.",0
" There are good bits among the bad (the giant's bullying, bratty kinfolk especially), but mostly, there's simply not enough there.",0
" It's intrinsically rousing stuff, although the journey is a little low on drama apart from the odd shark attack and a bit of bickering between Heyerdahl and his virtually indistinguishable crew of blond men with beards.",1
" The film drains the spark from four talented young actors with clunky dialogue and a crushingly dull narrative. The special effects aren't that special, either.",0

" [A] saggy, rickety and occasionally winded geriatric action thriller ...",0
" It's a wonder that a video game from the 1980s could efficiently set its premise up in a single cut scene, but a major Hollywood production in 2018 can't seem to get beyond mere exposition in its 107-minute running time.",0
" Thankfully, Burns and Soderbergh have more on their agenda than simply trashing the pharmaceutical industry.",1
 Not even children are spared in this gritty Mexican fantasy-thriller.,1
 Too bad Schwarzenegger is otherwise occupied these days.,0
" The conflicting speeds of the feature create chaos, derailing a familiar but promising junk food thriller, which tries much too hard to keep the viewer off the scent of a mystery they will likely show limited interest in to begin with. ",0
 A completely common and utterly excruciating high school ugly duckling romance so grossly out of touch with the times that even the title is passe.,0

" Boyhood is not only a masterful film but a culturally rich one as well, a cinematic equivalent to the Mark Twain coming of age classic ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" yet made for a new generation.",1
" It's far from awful, but Salvation is close to joyless, something easily predicted when this redundant film was first announced.",0
 An unexceptional workout for the adrenaline glands nudged up several notches by a climax that will cause muchos trouser trauma to all but the recently deceased.,1
" The plot, told almost in real time, is full of unbelievable situations. We see characters run, get upset, and be chased, however, the dramatic tension is almost non existent. [Full review in Spanish]",0

" I wouldn't care if she was at the epicentre of the movement for global peace: she's a happily married mother who looks like Uma Thurman, and my reserves of sympathy are limited.",0
" In an extraordinary series of tableaux that are alternately idyllic and severe, Sweetgrass defies the conventions of what most of us regard as a documentary film.",1
" With nothing at stake, John Curran's earnestly dull biopic hasn't much to offer except parched voiceovers, painfully slow child/parent flashbacks, sunburn and humps.",0
 This is a dazzlingly revealing and upsetting film.,1

" Congratulations, Kevin Smith. You just killed irony.",0
" A miniseries might have been able to knock this story out of the park, but the movie is a solid double.",1
" It's probably 20 minutes longer than it needs to be. But when you've got archival footage this electric, and present-day interviews with Iggy Pop that are almost as entertaining, you can't really blame him for overstuffing the package.",1

" A high action, shoot 'em up flick that bombards your senses as well as your common sense.",0
" Minghella has meticulously crafted an intimate epic that, while it does have a somewhat cerebral tone, is clearly determined to translate Frazier's vision of human hope amid great brutality to the screen.",1
 The movie replaces emotional precision and intellectual honesty with syrupy sincerity and insistence.,0
 A botch more concerned with creating a would-be franchise than in making a movie entertaining enough to make audiences want to see more.,0

" ""A Prairie Home Companion"" is an incredibly well-made and graceful film, with an unbelievably gifted cast dancing to the Midwestern poetry of Garrison Keillor's script and Robert Altman's direction.",1
 Boys is a poorly written and ill conceived drama that never even tries to involve the viewer.,0
 Not that the movie doesn't have its charms even for non-soccer-fans-though they may want to duck out for popcorn during the big game. Those who love the game can nudge the rating up a notch or two.,0
" Billed as a ""high-stakes financial thriller"", I found it more of an absurd snooze.",0
" Like the 20-foot-tall ballerina holograms pirouetting through its decrepit Los Angeles streets, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is hauntingly beautiful, technologically stunning and low on substance.",0

" Without an element of true discovery, however, Among The Believers is a cinematically, and artistically, flat result.",0
" Movies detailing the lives of corrupt, disinterested and/or otherwise tempted New York cops could and probably should constitute their own subgenre Netflix listing, so those inclined to like this sort of thing will find just enough about it to like; other",0

" La Vie en Rose is lucky to have Cotillard to hold things together, because it is constantly threatening to implode.",0
" You'll want to get lost in the dark world of ""We Own the Night."" Good performances from a great cast blend with an intriguing script in this adult thriller/melodrama.",1
 There's a distasteful brand of insincerity that pervades Me Before You.,0
 Argento strands his actors in a variety of crummy master shots and close-ups that accentuate their every exaggerated gesture and line-reading.,0

 A tepid sequel no one was really clamouring for. ,0
" Bolstered by outrageous humor, Thank You for Smoking grazes the main players and bystanders discussing national welfare from their own self-interest.",1
" The Gunman might be Penn's bid to step into an action franchise, but a talent of his caliber deserves better than this.",0
" Fortunately, what keeps this film afloat - barely - is its spot-on casting. Everyone is picture perfect.",0
" Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.",0
" Okay, so it's only minor Mamet, but, for loyal devotees of the master, like me, it is still sublime. Rich in Mamet's signature staccato cadence, the dialog is pure poetry.",1
 [Lopez is] nothing if not a woman who knows her brand... and Second Act is perfectly tailored to it.,1
 Excellent dramatic storytelling.,1
" If this world has you in need of a little healing time, go, go, go and see it: it's a lovely, gracious, soul-satisfying thing.",1

 There are enough laughs in it if you're willing to settle.,0
" Fantastically smug, empty picture, which comes complete with a nasty-tasting dab of misogyny.",0

 It's like Back to the Future without the laughs.,0
" We tip our caps to Kahn & Co.'s underdog story. But satire-wise, there's some killer bars left on the killing floor here.",0
" Mistress America has enough bumps and bruises to keep it from being a superhero among comedy-drama movies, but it's not from a lack of trying by Gerwig. Her energy's enough to take a chance on this film.",1
" Not particularly funny nor memorable, but at least [it] has a few saving graces due to a solid cast and doesn't leave you feeling like you wasted your time.",0
" An entertaining film full of blood, guts, dark humor and very politically incorrect situations. [Full review in Spanish]",1

" The apex of director Olivier Assayas's already impressive career, it's a landmark of pop politics taken to extremes.",1
" The best that Shyamalan has done in fifteen years and is, without a doubt, the best geek surprise so far this year. A must-see film that will undoubtedly earn an intriguing cult status. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 The pretty pictures aren't enough to enliven a slow-pokey horse opera that plays like blandly generic kid stuff.,0
" Kudos are deserved everywhere for a well-written, beautifully played and offbeat piece of re-imagined history that's always funny despite humour sometimes stemming from a distinct sense of unease.",1
" There are some dark laughs, but the film doesn't commit to being dark, like the film doesn't mean it, and it always pulls back.",0
" enough ancillary surprises, and clever spins on classic tropes, to add a piquant sense of discovery, as well as some genuinely gripping suspense",1
" Like everything else Allen has done in the last decade -- dull, self-indulgent and not funny. Enough, already.",0
 Two powerful performances and a glimpse at the inner workings of the lower levels of the mob make this a must see.,1

" Although the scenarios seem forced, the action feels natural thanks to the nonchalant delivery of a fine cast ...",1
" Desplechin mines his earlier films and his cultural obsessions for a formidable trove of narrative complications, which he flings into the script with admirable abandon but without directorial audacity to match.",0
" Digging for Fire has an absolutely loaded cast full of recognizable names, but does nothing with them;",0
" There's a serviceable framework to the narrative, but almost everything stands in diminished contrast to the first film.",0

" Berkowitz went to great trouble to stage, edit, and control certain aspects of his film so that it has a formulaic dramatic structure; one wonders why he didn't make the effort to present himself as a likable human being.",0
 Looks pretty much like every other comedy spy movie and in its own way is kinda keeping up with the Joneses.,0
 A beautifully internalized performance from Ms. Thompson and the various efforts to highlight the cinematic potential in Fiona's anguish... can't override the tidy ironies of Mr. McEwan's design.,0
" Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.",0
" It continually spins its wheels or even goes in reverse, backtracking to previous points to load new information.",0
" Mostly delightful. It can give you the foreboding you feel when encountering the word ""artisanal,"" but otherwise this nested story of Central European skullduggery seems to have more of a spine than anything he's made since Fantastic Mr. Fox. ",1
" Alice in Wonderland is a lovely display of Tim Burton's amazing offbeat aesthetics which win me over every time, but sadly doesn't make for very much of a film.",0
 The tone is wildly uneven and the concept ultimately feels strained at feature length. ,0
" The film refuses to follow any one strand of political logic, and as such exists on an insufficient amount of thematic oxygen to support its loaded dramatic context.",0
" Once you start reckoning with Anomalisa's obsession with self-absorption, the novelty of this one-man pity party begins to wear off. A little puppet pain goes a long way.",0
" Altogether, ""Escape Room"" scores some unexpected points given the circumstances, but falls short of what it might have been with another draft or two back in the writing stage.",0
" While it's hardly a work of groundbreaking originality, it's a heck of a lot more fun than the majority of horror films churned out at the moment.",1
 Mooney and his pals have created a love letter to nostalgia. Don't dismiss this unorthodox ode to cartoons of old --- it's a treasure. ,1

" ""Forever My Girl"" is barely a step above a Lifetime movie.",0
" Distinctly Allen-esque, but dominated by Cate Blanchett's stunning lead performance -- a masterful tightrope walk of delusion and deliberation that keeps the effort absorbing and darkly comic. ",1

 Witless romantic comedy with hooks and lines that are all stinkers.,0

" Though gimmicky, implausible and repetitious with too many angles, this thriller is still worth seeing as exercise in audience participation in narrative creation and as commentary on the manipulative processes of filmmaking and engagement of spectators",1

 Mostly Rings offers the warmed-up leftovers of a style that hasn't felt fresh since the first George W. Bush administration. It's an unkind rewind.,0

 Fascinating shots of hundreds of scientists glued to rows of video terminals and switchboards are reduced to mere wallpaper; the work at hand remains a mystery.,0

" The Mexican is sporadically entertaining. It works when Gandolfini is on screen; when he leaves, he takes the movie with him.",0
" Its aims at college misogyny are valiant and a couple of the jokes land decently enough, but Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising misses its target in trying to capture what made the first film such a success with its audience",0
" While there aren't more than a handful of gut-busting, laugh-aloud moments, there is enough sly, slick humor to keep the average viewer chuckling throughout.",1

 You'll be lucky to remember anything about this new one when you wake up the morning after seeing it.,0
 We're all entitled to our own opinions regarding his past but Polanski deserves credit as a filmmaker. The Ghost Writer proves that he's as good as ever at the age of 77.,1

" Full of memorable dialogue and sharp performances, it's let down only by its perfunctory climax.",1
" Battle in Heaven is less about heaven or battle, or hell on earth, or the soul of Mexico, and all too much about gawking. And so, for all the 'shock' of the movie's clinical carnality, this battle is lost.",0
" In this impossible situation, a powerful but stammering, 15-year love affair gives the movie its emotional weight.",1
" While this flimsy coming-of-age drama over-relies on the Boss's greatest hits for its emotional high points, ""Blinded by the Light"" remains a likeable and touching story about finding your own voice.",1
 Consistently entertains through its emphasis on amusing anecdotes rather than hard facts.,1
" The Green Hornet is a disjointed jumble of gag laughs, goofy stunts, and bizzare casting.",0
 Zhang could not shoot an unbeautiful scene if he tried.,1

" Unfortunately, it wears out its welcome about two-thirds through, which means -- no kidding -- 45 more minutes to go.",0
" In conclusion, it's not the best of Disney-Pixar, but it's definitely the best one of the saga because of its life metaphors. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" The movie works when it makes fun of other films in the genre, but its affraid to completely embrace the idea of being single. [Full review in Spanish]",1

 The Bucket List must have seemed like a good idea -- around 1985.,0
 It just feels like more cute but disposable holiday junk to clutter this increasingly overstuffed season.,0
" Essentially, and without surprise, this is an unreviewable picture. It's beyond silly, full of logically impaired characters doing increasingly stupid things as the film progresses.",0

 A quest saga whose metaphysical digressions and dream interludes will fascinate and frustrate in equal measure.,1
" [Dr. Farmer's] quiet outrage over the widely-held assumption that it's futile to treat the global poor drives this story, which is finally as much about the triumph of a philosophy as of medicine.",1
" With Boogie Nights we know we're not just watching episodes from disparate lives but a panorama of recent social history, rendered in bold, exuberant colors.",1
" While the pair of them look like they might just perhaps be able to make this highly improbable and dubiously conservative nonsense vaguely amusing, they don't.",0
 The Highwaymen falls short of making the case that the good guys had the better tale.,1
" It takes an exceptionally talentless screenwriter-director to make such a foul, boring, worthless descreation of DeFoe's witty, insightful and entertaining novel, and Densham is that incompetent.",0

" Baby Driver may not quite hit the heights of Shaun or Hot Fuzz, but it's bursting with invention, stunning action and killer tunes. ",1

" It turns out to be a rousing, full blooded war movie but one which also sometimes feels derivative and a little heavy handed.",1
 The movie drags so much in the opening acts that it saps much of the funny right out of Mac's performance.,0
" It's scary and fun, if your idea of fun involves occasional gore and torture, things like that. Plus: Christmas decorations!",1
 The opening six-minute shot of dawn breaking over a rural landscape is worth the price of admission alone. Stunning.,1
" Trishna is an admirable effort, but it's too detached and disinterested in the viewer to make an impact. This is a tough film to get through, and even if one makes it to the end, there's little reward to be found.",0
" Chadwick Boseman delivers a precise impersonation of Brown's gravelly voice and eccentric moves, and even lends emotional weight to the few scenes that deserve it. However, his role feels more like a series of bullet points than an organic character. ",0
 The softness and straightness of the performances obscure the monstrous melodrama underneath.,1
" That's right, it's time for yet another entry in that most-dreaded of genres: The XXXTREME Sports Movie.",0
" Berg clearly has nothing but reverence for the armed forces, but that admiration renders him incapable of portraying anything dispassionately.",0
" The opening act muddles the narrative a little and the talking heads sometimes become unimaginative, but with a superb control of story, Schroeder's unflinching footage inspires its audience to care about these outrageous crimes.",1
 ...I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story is a profoundly moving documentary. ,1

 A supernatural spell of boringness smothers it all.,0
 Iron Man may not be distinguished enough to convert you to the cause. But Downey and Favreau give the movie a quirky flavor it can call its own. For that we can be grateful.,1

 Finders Keepers has the sort of plot that no screenwriter in his or her right mind would ever dream up.,1
 It's at best a brainless -- and highly derivative -- diversion.,0
 Worthy of some attention because it happens to portray the [Afghanistan] culture -- specifically the treatment of women in that Taliban stronghold -- in forceful and dramatic terms.,1
 Hitman is inspired by a video game. That of course carries all sorts of baggage.,0

" Analyzed on its own merits or in concert with the earlier film, Point Break doesn't work.",0
" The compromised result is suspended between a childlike sense of discovery and a corporate sense of duty - at no point does it feel like the story and the graphics are talking to each other, or even in the same language.",0
" These feelings existed before, and they'll exist again. And sometimes, someone decides to make a movie about them.",1

 ... more howlers than a convention of timberwolves.,0

 Snakes was the best instantly disposable cinematic event I've attended since Bride of Chucky was launched on an unsuspecting world eight years ago.,1
" One can't help but feel that the Disney-Depp partnership has taken the series as far as it can go in this form, and short of a large-scale overhaul of the franchise, it may be best to set these particular Pirates adrift for good.",0
" Sound like Robert Altman directing a Cameron Crowe-rejected screenplay while on speed? Yes, and it seems that way when on the screen.",0
" With special effects rarely seen on a real person, the Robert Rodriguez film turns in exciting sequences that can sometimes get lost in the two stories that run through the film. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" This kind of unhurried, low-conflict story coming from a mainstream filmmaker might be more invigorating if not for the eventually wearying idealization of the De Niro character and the odd implications that come along with it.",0
" The filmmakers seem to have missed an opportunity to deal in a sophisticated way with a thorny, important subject. Still, you'll probably cry anyway. It's that kind of film.",0

" Truth be told, The Yards is pretty much a mess.",0
" Totally satisfying sequel, packing a powerful wallop...",1
" It's a clever film. And for all Soderbergh's reservations about Hollywood, it's also confirmation of his mastery of its assorted genres, although he does suffer from an urge to see if he can juggle them all at the same time.",1
 It has a visual syntax so eloquent -- its fields of gold cause its quiet characters to stand out like mythic figures -- it would play powerfully as a silent film. ,1
" It's over long before it's over, by the time you start wishing that a few of the dogs from ""Best in Show"" would show up; a one-note comedy, pounded with a hammer and left flat.",0

 What happened in long-ago Salem does still seem to matter.,1
 There isn't much about Virus that you won't know by guessing.,0

 Revenge is the common thread that links Damian Szifron's six fearlessly entertaining tales that range from uproariously funny to bleakly black. ,1

" Youth, not at all helped by Sorrentino's tin ear for English, doesn't reach the heights of his Oscar-winning The Great Beauty.",1
" Jokes only get you so far, and The Goods gets increasingly bogged down in its uninspired plotlines. Ferrell's cameo is a particular lowpoint.",0
" Ridiculous and cheesy, ""Uprising"" is a sad follow-up to a promising unique idea. Sure, these films are just monster movies, but the 2013 flick had bite and narrative depth giving the effects more impact. This sequel is positively wince-inducing.",0

 Vampire Academy is entertaining.,1

" Vampire Academy is just another failure in a long line of similarly structured experiences and quite frankly, the fact that there are six of these books blows my mind.",0
 I'm kind of let down Collateral Beauty isn't a magnificent disaster as I'd been led to believe. It's just another movie that doesn't understand why its premise is not harmless whimsical fun.,0

 Pirate Radio takes a great story -- the hugely popular offshore radio stations that illegally broadcast pop and rock in 1960s Britain -- and turns it into an aggressively irritating floating frat-party romp.,0
" Director Denis Villeneuve is the modern master of empty, thundering portent, and the dystopic future cinematic universe of Blade Runner gives him a gigantic space to practice his darkly didactic arts.",0
 Folman uses the live action half of his film to champion real acting over motion capture; it's almost fitting that The Congress loses our interest as soon as it drifts into the ethereal.,1

" Whichever side of the political divide one may stand, one can't dismiss Dhar's canniness and craft, despite knowing that he is lionising the obvious and providing a one-sided narrative.",1

 It feels almost treacherous to confess that Mary Queen of Scots left me as cold as the execution axe's blade -- and that's after watching twice to make sure I wasn't missing something.,0

 Calculated quirkiness and cartoonish characterizations make Save the Date shallow enough to be a sitcom pilot.,0

 Kiarostami still possesses a remarkable knack for crafting vivid supporting characters from just a few details.,1
" Not so much anti-gay as it is anti-humor, it's easily Adam Sandler's worst comedy ever, and it's depressing to watch him strain to be a Walter Matthau to Kevin James' sweetly exasperated Jack Lemmon. It's a groaningly obvious, abysmally unfunny dud.",0

 It features so much in the way of awkward and contrived situations that even an extremely talented cast nearly flounders.,0

" Much of the film is a setup for hoped-for sequels, so the plot isn't really the thing. But Daredevil benefits from some strong supporting roles.",1
" It Follows is unnerving without being bloody, and more than this, that it cleverly inverts the sexual politics on which so much popular culture, most especially the horror film, often depends.",1
" Stanton should go back to making machines talk. He puts much more humanity into them than he manages to extract from Burroughs, even with all that nostalgia working for him. ",0
" From what is a fairly big name cast, LaBute gets absolutely nothing out of them, and the narrative is similarly choppy and disjointed. Tracy Morgan is the only actor to come out of the film without his career taking a hit.",0

 There are simply no funny lines here.,0
 This doesn't depart too far from the familiar template of boy-men obliged to morph from dyed-in-the-wool party animals to responsible adults but it does it well enough.,1
" The more brutal this becomes, the less anything other than blood and guts seems to matter. Just because watching every gory detail of a man getting torn limb from limb turns the stomach doesn't mean it quickens the pulse.",0
" It accumulates simplistic conceptual repetitions, other grossly emotional ones, unworthy music and some super impressions that, again, make us doubt about who the real Van Sant is. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
 What's shocking here is the inanity of it all.,0
" That a star-filled romantic comedy based on a pop best-seller adheres to convention doesn't surprise, but the filmmakers go too far by forcing two of the most pathological characters together.",0
" Not a sci-fi movie but a droll, totally charming, un-hokey romantic comedy about two misfits. The film belongs to Aubrey Plaza's deadpan, touching, understated performance. ",1
" There's plenty of energy on offer and some visual flair, and everyone's heart seems to be in the right place. But it's pretty clear why Dano threw his hat in.",0

" True enchantment will elude those, like me, who remain impervious to Anderson's affected style and whimsical humour.",0
 It sounds boring because it is.,0
" Black Mass is a tightly wound piece of work, and Cooper keeps its many small parts moving with ease.",1
 The script and plot become far too predictable -- to the point that the audience knows exactly where it's going to go and reluctantly follows it.,0
" Coppola...tugs at that feeling of weightlessness you get when you're in a foreign country, the sense of discovery but also the solitude",1
" Eventually Dear John piles on so much tragedy that it becomes laughable, a parade of contrivances keeping the bland lovers apart.",0
 A flattening pile of artifice and conceit disguised as a road comedy.,0
" The film's very old-fashioned sense of right and wrong is refreshing. However, the need for strong plotting and characterisation...never goes out of vogue, and it's on these terms that Water For Elephants feels truncated. ",0
" You can't be too hard on a film that blows up a Rainforest Cafe, can you?",0
 ...a movie that would probably be better off as a poem.,0
" Veering between sumptuously painterly and watching paint dry. While throughout the interminable running time bedside vigil, the characters displaying far greater endurance than we do within this extreme reality check-free zone ordeal, is not a good sign.",0

" A gripping thriller, this one is bold, audacious and shocking.",1

 One of the best performances of the year from Winstead...I encourage you to see it.,1
 The basic plot and acting are good but those stilted monologues are entertainment killers.,0

 This pedestrian thriller plonks poor Liam Neeson back in a leather jacket and armed with a gun for another one of those 'Taken Lite' outings.,0
" The story offers no scares or surprises (other than things popping out suddenly from corners), but it checks off the boxes without actively insulting your intelligence. ",0
 Wilson's disengagement often seems motivated by genuine lack of interest more than smouldering impotence.,0
" Generally speaking, the film suffers from a somewhat fuzzy storytelling style.",0
 The Aviator is the perfect melding of talent and material.,1
" Along the same lines as Paris je t'aime, the film is a collection of unrelated stories that are meshed together without rhyme or reason. Some of them work, some do not",0
" Coppola knows she's treading water here, but she's smart enough to make that in itself her film's subject, spinning an extra variation, perhaps this one last time, on the adage to work with what you know.",1
 Disjointed and unsatisfying. While some stories soar - the titular vignette is stirring and beautiful - too many others fall flat or get lost in the search for profundity as characters spend an inordinate amount of time staring into the middle distance.,0
" Mechanical and formulaic, but the formula is amusing and it goes down smoothly enough to pass for something original.",1
" I can't figure out exactly when the film 10,000 B.C. is set, but it's definitely ancient times. Like before they had cars, guns or tabloid blogs. And definitely before they had cohesive plots or dialogue that made sense.",0
 We've seen this a hundred times before...only better.,0
 A film that encourages multiple viewings in order to unpack its layers and secrets.,1

 The magic is minuscule in this handsome-looking but drearily told animated tale.,0
" It's quick, it has an actual enjoyable heist storyline and it's good fun.",1
 A supernatural horror movie that will move your pulse in places but do little to nudge your soul.,0
 Kristen Wiig becomes a movie star and takes back the term 'chick flick.' Bridesmaids has a big heart and a grown-up mouth.,1

 At least it's short.,0
" When huge chunks of character development and narrative exposition are relegated to a track announcer's running commentary, it can never be a good sign.",0
" If you go into a movie called ""Rampage"" that stars Dwayne Johnson, you pretty much know what to expect...and this movie does a fairly good job of meeting that low-bar. ",1

" A comical and terrifying satire of the American way of life, which indicates that stories about returning from war may be entering a new dimension thanks to new technologies. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Elle is such a nice person, and Witherspoon so effervescent, it seems impolite to point out that this comedy is hardly ever funny, unless you get a big kick out of seeing small dogs in cute outfits. Over and over and over again.",0

" Katherine Heigl carries 27 Dresses when all else fails, which it does with great regularity.",0
" What in the world is going on with I Heart Huckabees? Please, someone e-mail me and let me know.",0
 Neither Odenkirk's limp direction nor SNL alumnus Will Forte's script -- not nearly clever enough to get away with its questionable gags about matters sexual and racial -- provides much by way of actual plot or comedy.,0
 The results aren't ribald or provocative or particularly exciting in any way; it's just a slog that will appeal mainly to enthusiasts of 19th-century undergarments.,0
" Surveying the doomed 1954 retreat of French and Laotian soldiers, Schoendoerffer exposes, with a reporter's eye, the horrors that were and the horrors to come.",1
" As middlebrow, medium-impact melodrama goes, you could do worse.",1

 There are so many things wrong with Lady that there just isn't enough space to go into them here.,0

 High on stuntwork and low on logic ...,0
 Cut Bank is an entertaining enough movie with a good cast who mostly perform well. It just isn't the groundbreaking genre-buster its makers apparently think it is.,1
" Invictus is stately, handsomely mounted, attentive to detail right down to the Marmite adorning the team's breakfast buffet, and relentlessly conventional.",0
" For fans who say they'd pay to watch Brad Pitt read the Yellow Pages -- well, your money might be better-spent on that.",0
" For Illumination Entertainment, ""Sing"" is a game-changer, underscoring why company founder Chris Meledandri is the hottest name in animation today.",1
" Unimaginative, uninspired and unentertaining, xXx: Return of Xander Cage is a film no one was waiting for, and one there's no reason to pony up theater ticket prices for. ",0
 The best unintentional comedy of the year. ,0
" Helen Mirren is, of course, a wonderful actress, and she brings dignity to the marvellously Euro-chic Maria, but even she can't soar above the script which veers from speechifying to banalities.",1
" Nichols' built-for-speed tribute to Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter does his influences proud, while also suggesting he's still expanding his horizons. Right now, he's as good as we've got.",1
" With about half an hour left, Dear John took a shark-jumping turn that ruined the entire film for me.",0
" Ruined by Hendler's pointlessly artsy direction, a stab at postmodern snarkiness and an unconscionable 101-minute running time.",0
" Melodrama, yes. But effectively done with a dream cast.",1
" It's much more of an action flick than either Metropolis or Blade Runner, but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon.",1
" Inconsistent and undisciplined, Minions is more an adjunct to marketing than a legitimate motion picture.",0
" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" takes audiences back to the worst of the AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height.",1
 The film skips back and forth between several short stories (originally written by A.M. Homes) that are more driven by atmosphere than plot. Yet Troche somehow fails to give them much of either.,0
" Corbijn is great at taking real-life flesh and blood people and alchemically rendering them in striking 2-dimensional images that transcend and mythologize the reality, but ""Life"" shows him fall some way short of achieving the reverse.",0
 There are bits and pieces of a dandy film here that get choked out by a barrier of unproductive mulch.,0
" So much of Oldboy works so well that it's a huge disappointment when the movie loses its nerve in the climax, opting for a radically different and less subversive ending than the original.",1
" We've seen movies and television about this sort of man before, and one of Moonlight's strongest assets is the way it refines this character type, subverting the narrative.",1
" The simultaneously diverting and annoying Chronicle, directed by Josh Trask, is something like the 184th Found-Footage Faux-Doc horror movie of the past few years.",0
" No doubt Alex Ross Perry will follow up the film with a strong return to form, but this film is a collection of half-realized ideas and characters.",0
 It's forty minutes of steely violence and two hours of cliche-ridden flab.,0
" A lot of it could pass for a documentary, until upon reflection you realize how carefully Esparza's set up his story beats.",1

" Demon is a powerful movie that, once seen, can't be easily shaken off.",1
" A Cormac McCarthy horror-mystery with all its ingenuity and without Hollywood compromise. Happily for literature, the movie retains the fright and power of the novel with its shock ending.",1
" There's still a lot of excellent work in Snow Angels. The first hour is utterly engrossing. But there's also a lot of wasted potential, which is too bad.",1
" Even though this film has two attractive stars, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, it's about the dinosaurs. Nobody's ever going to see a real dinosaur but these look more like the real thing than, well, the real thing. This movie is a treat!",1
" Despite the characters and the subject matter, the film is underwhelming, though Firth's acting is a masterwork of understatement.",0
 Margot is sensually as well as dramatically impoverished.,0
" Buttermaker is ornery but strangely resigned, smart enough to know he's settled for a crap life, but too exhausted to do much about it.",0
" Mediocre more than an utter failure, ""Friends with Benefits"" ought to be forgotten in the shadow of the smarter, funnier, sweeter, and altogether superior ""No Strings Attached.""",0
" This accomplished essay film may focus on our state, but Stratman's real concern is state power in the larger sense...Connecting all this are sweeping aerial shots that capture the beauty of the plains without obscuring the blood spilled to claim them.",1
 Hints of a quasi-apocalyptic chill seem arbitrary-neither symbolic nor dramatic. The effect is like watching software run itself.,0
 Only auds not exposed to similar inspirational sports scenarios will doubt for a second that she'll eventually succeed.,0
" Snyder's take on Watchmen is both too much and too little all at the same time, and while a great deal of it is certainly extraordinary the majority is distant, cold and ultimately infuriating.",0
 A straightforward and uninspired look at the sex trade.,0

 This should be required viewing for anyone trying to better understand the sometimes crippling emotional weight of body dysmorphia.,1
 The two [actors] have enough chemistry to get you past any queasiness about the age difference.,1
 There's so much menace and portent in this adaptation of Armistead Maupin's novel that you're psyched for a high-voltage compound of shock and awe that never materializes.,0
 Just clever enough and characters just winning enough to hold our interest long enough to be surprised at the end,1
 Implementing a color scheme of black on different shades of dark gray with bright neon highlights of blue or red ... the movie is a drab and depressing thing to look at.,0
" There are some plot-twisting musings on mortality and the soul that are thoughtful, sure. But they aren't thought through half as fully as Blomkamp's ultraviolent battle choreography.",1
" Quale's biggest failing is not sticking strictly to the ""found footage"" rules. There are too many scenes in which the style is dropped, which keep undermining the movie's overall structure.",0
" Filmmaker Andrew Niccol, working from his own screenplay, does an absolutely astonishing job of initially establishing the futuristic landscape wherein the plot transpires...",1
 The result is a compellingly flesh-and-blood depiction of King; an absorbingly sophisticated account of his brand of non-violent activism.,1
" Rather than illuminating hard truths about decisions made in the context of domestic oppression and uprising, the film instead bogs itself down in ambiguous moralizing, voiding the audience's ability to root for any interest or character.",0
" It's the whole proud, embarrassing sociopolitical, cultural heap of American history-and the American Century in particular-in two fleet, funny hours. [Blu-ray]",1
" The short-subject treatment serves as a challenge that, in eighty minutes, writer-director Matthew Weiss doesn't meet.",0
 Elle makes a strong case for the actress as auteur. ,1
" CRD is the kind of film that makes you wonder about the people on the periphery, flirting with limelight but never really in it.",1
" What Cooper manages to achieve through his simple, uncomplicated storytelling is a remarkable magnification of time. ",1
" Nearly too stupid to be considered misogynistic (although not quite), Chloe would be straight-to-video if it starred lesser actors and bore the name of a director considered trashier like Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne.",0
" The third installment still reads as angry, but the ire comes across as self-loathing, the filmmakers unable to mask their cynicism about their own project.",0
" A slight exercise in sentiment, a funny Hallmark card to the bereaved. ",0
" Underneath the movie's cold surface, Cold Mountain turns out to be a volcano.",1
" There are sequences of such breathtaking skill and confidence that I believe the film must be seen by everyone who ever hopes to make, or even talk intelligently, about movies.",1
 Red instead exhibits all the get-up-and-go of a grandpa on the verge of an afternoon nap.,0

 Another bottom-of-the-barrel raunchfest that is bound to make far more money than such sludge could ever deserve.,0
" The film can afford such narrative economy in part because Gosling is so effective, needing little in the way of words to convey the complexity of his character.",1
" It's good clean fun nevertheless, and the set pieces expertly supply the tension-and-release satisfactions of the genre",1
 One of the toughest forms of nostalgia is a yearning for times that were anything but peaceful.,1
" Even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful, strenuous and hyperactive fantasy, which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment.",0
 It illuminates the sinister logic of a new world order that depends on corrupt globalization to put an acceptable face on age-old colonialism.,1
" Director Crystal Moselle stands back from her subjects, allowing them to do most of the talking. Her camera is remarkably non-judgmental, especially given how easily it could have become a ""look at the freak show"" sort of film.",1
 Housebound does ghosts in the walls with the same wacky panache as the recent Wyrmwood did Aussie zombies.,1

" Lust, Caution is so ambitious and detailed that you'll never be bored.",1
" After walking out of ATTENBERG, I couldn't decide if I really hated it, or really loved it. I still can't decide. ATTENBERG stretches the arthouse genre to ""WTF!?""",1

 There's no denying this is something of a vanity project ... but it still feels very earnest.,1
" A handful of sparky leads can't help this superhero reboot find an appropriate tone. No no, Power Rangers.",0
 The Salvation has everything a good Western should have.,1
 the screenwriters have failed to construct a story that works on any level. It is simply not funny ... Landis gets the tone badly wrong,0
" Darkness Falls is the movie to see if you've ever wondered what a movie plays like with all the unimportant stuff -- narrative, character development -- cut out and the action kept in.",0
" A generally bad time at the movies, and the only significant payoff is a reinforced feeling that Eli Roth is terrified of anyone who isn't an upper-middle-class millennial.",0
 The film's main problems stem from its uneven efforts to marry purple passion with black comedy.,1
" A New Wave masterpiece... coursing with at first the unruly passion of young love and then the measured, mannered wiseness of adolescence's surrender to adulthood.",1

" An impassioned, funny and monumentally likable myth-making comedy.",1
" As a family friendly movie, The Game Plan works perfectly well.",0
" Think of a famous Hendrix song. For that matter, think of an obscure Hendrix song. Whatever you're thinking of, it's not in the movie. That's a little like making a film about Henry Ford without ever showing a car.",0
" The first Kick-Ass wasn't a great movie, but it did have two great jokes driving it. With Kick-Ass 2, the joke is entirely on the audience.",0
 Hepburn is utterly beguiling in her star-making role opposite Peck in a delightful romantic comedy about a poised young princess of an unspecified European country who spends a magical day with an American reporter playing hooky.,1
 [One] plotline ends with a twist that doubtless felt more authentic in the halls of a film school than it would on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.,0
" The absence of a seasoned lead figure is a decisive flaw, with the same to be said about the writing. The religious inserts only make it blasphemous to the gods of cinema.",0

 A glum and dispiriting counterfeit of reality that turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch.,0
 My only complaint about The Raid is that it ended.,1
 All the pieces combined feel like nothing more than a barrage of exquisitely crafted names,0
" There's a reason nobody's made a motion picture about the Bondurant Boys before now. As ruthless, gun-toting gangs go, they're kind of on the snoozy side.",0

 There are two very fine performances here -- Wood's and Amurri's -- but they're not strong enough to rise above the metaphor-laden script.,0
" Nothing really fits together and just to make it worse, the movie is ugly.",0
" [S]ome critics are failing to notice that this rather flawed film is set on the shoulders of Paul Giamatti who, with impressive stamina and spirit ... commands our attention more effectively than any other Hollywood leading man could.",1

 Suffers from a contemporary take on a very period piece.,0
 It is fun to see Wanda de Jesus get all Pam Grier and shoot off two big guns at once after making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for her son. But the big dumb story and the big dumb dialogue keep getting in the way.,0
 Maleficent isn't really an adaptation of Sleeping Beauty. It's an adaptation of a screen saver.,0
 Pleasant but slight.,1

 The film creates one of the most chillingly becalmed portraits of insanity I've seen. ,1
" It's nice to give the women a chance to play what is by and large a man's game; the problem is that the territory the movie covers, on both the bridal side and the gross-out side, is well worn.",1
" For the most part the screenwriters never lose sight of the moral of this story: Whatever else gets tossed into the mix, Shrek must be the heart and soul. In this, Myers is a master; he makes it seem easy being green.",1
 Young boys will probably eat this stuff up but older fans of the cartoons might leave the movie feeling like the Wachowskis have taken a big fat multi-colored dump on their sense of nostalgia.,0
" This movie is action, horror, and comedy by way of Hogwarts, and it's frightfully fun. Occasionally scary, and even scarier for how often the film works.",1

 The film wears its inspirational family values on its sleeve in such an overstated way that it's clear that no one involved really believes them for a minute. It is so contrived and so careful not to offend that it has no real energy.,0

" In playing an everyman stranded between anger and duty, Clooney earns an emotional payoff that a lesser actor would simply demand.",1

" Though Simmons gnaws through the screen with every glance, Teller's a suitably brutal canvas.",1
" It's just a shame that, when the punching and kicking really gets started during the film's final third, the 140-minute tale goes flabby due to an uncomfortable mix of sincere populist enthusiasm and artistic ambition.",0

 Happy Feet will leave your kids toe tapping all the way home. I've seen it firsthand. They actually leave the theater bouncing off the walls. Good luck putting them to sleep at bedtime.,1
" ""Night School"" could have been better. A LOT better. Instead, we get a meandering story where the plot is sparse and the jokes are even sparser. ",0
" It's meant to be thrilling fun, but it never takes off in the way imagined. There's no merriment in the .357-caliber chaos, no mirth in the staccato of bullets.",0

 The film fulfills its limited mandate of providing fast-paced adventure and some nice eye candy without adding anything memorable to the tale of The Boy Who Can Fly.,1
" Rutten is a natural ham, and his off-kilter, upbeat, Euro-kook personality is one of the movie's wild cards, and keeps a story that relies heavily on formula from being stale.",1

 There are two very fine performances here -- Wood's and Amurri's -- but they're not strong enough to rise above the metaphor-laden script.,0
 Ruby Sparks might have been more fun if Cal were written to be expansive instead of a worrywart in the middle-aged Matthew Broderick mode.,0

 Westfeldt's sloppy love letter to herself and corralled Hamm's friends to help sell it. ,0
" I couldn't tell whether the film was intended to be a comedy; as it became more and more improbable, both predictable and ludicrous at once, I heard audience members chortle again and again. Were they laughing with ""Money Monster"" or at it?",0
" They don't make 'em like ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" any more. Mainly because everyone got bored with 'em and stopped watching 'em.",0

 The whole thing feels maddeningly incomplete. We get only the sketchiest of characters. (Parental Movie Review also available),0

" Once seen, instantly forgotten.",0
" The Big Short isn't quite as hard-hitting as J.C. Chandor's Margin Call, but it's a nonetheless effective examination of a nationwide disaster so ridiculous that it's difficult not to laugh.",1
 It is asking a lot of any director to put a group of men in a diving bell and sustain the same level of tension throughout.,1
" Fairly typical comedy, in that moments of genuine humor are spread out too thinly over a schmaltzy (sorry, ""heartwarming"") script. But how can you give a failing grade to a movie that spotlights silly early Eighties music?",0

 Me Before You is so much more enjoyable than it could have -- and probably should have -- been. Amid the patronizing writing and perfectly timed Ed Sheeran songs are some truly entertaining moments between the leads.,1

 Whimsical Nanny McPhee is the most magical child minder to come along since Mary Poppins.,1

" [Lemmon's character is] a whingeing, self-pitying figure who, like other Wilder practitioners, cannot recognise the extent of his turpitude, and this is both the strength and weakness of a remarkable movie.",1
 Doug Liman's half-inventive 'Full Metal Alien Groundhog Day' war film is buoyed at first by Tom Cruise's rascally twinkle before falling back on shopworn battle-bot effects and videogame plotting.,0
 It's both impressive and sad that the 1987 original is still the high water mark of the series. The latest installment won't challenge for the throne and isn't a contender.,0
" Given how rigid and formulaic most mainstream animation is, there's something liberating about watching a traditionally hand-drawn cartoon thumb its nose so gleefully at traditional G-rated storytelling.",1
 It knows what it's doing and it's awesome... Crank relishes in its outrageous stunts... Jason Statham is a one man Die Hard. ,1
" As a child of the '80s, this reviewer had high expectations for this classic horror fable and director Andy Muschietti mostly manages to live up to them.",1
" Thanks to Statham, it's often tremendous fun - and sometimes just surreal (check the Geri Halliwell cameo) - so it's too bad its demeaning, indefensible attitude towards women and casual racism leaves such a sour taste in the mouth.",0
" As Ruth, Pfeiffer convincingly portrays a pampered woman left with utterly nothing - she's lost her homes, status and, most important, her relationship with her sons.",1
" Slapstick, but gross-out humor.",0
 Don't expect anything new other than what you already expect from this film. [Full review in Spanish],0
 It is very effective at creating adoration for a pig made of ones and zeroes. There might be a few tears in there too.,1

 One of the best films to hit theaters this year %u2013 Neil Burger's direction delivers a tale that is magic from beginning to end.,1
 There's a melancholy to La La Land that makes it linger.,1
" It's enough to make you cry. Equally, it might make you laugh. Daniels is a director who would find it hard to imagine puddings can be over-egged, or that Monty Python's 'We're So Poor' sketch was meant to be funny.",0
" Ends up as something I could only watch just one day and never again. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)",0

 Yves Saint Laurent changed the world; 'Yves Saint Laurent' simply follows procedure.,0
 Non-Stop takes itself way too seriously.,0
" Una's ambivalence over her own abuse is upsetting, but rather than attempting to condemn the relationship from the outside, the film merely allows the complexity of Una's trauma to speak for itself.",1
" Like a nuclear arsenal launched by an insane despot, Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" aims for a million different targets and incinerates them beyond recognition.",0
" Take away the titular gimmick, and the film would be a standard-issue family drama with nothing to set it apart from other oft-told tales of suburban ennui.",0
" They'd done it -- ""they,"" of course, being Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford. They had brought Indy back to us, our Indy, and they hadn't screwed it up.",1

 A plot so insanely stupid it can only mean one thing: You are watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.,0
" More charitable viewers may struggle along with it, giving it the benefit of the doubt, expecting it to at least stick the landing. ",0
 There is little novelty in a plot that only appears rehashed (probably for the nth time) with some annoying and ethically questionable police methodology.,0

" Mr. Ejiofor gives a commanding performance, perfectly calibrated in what's withheld just as much as what's revealed.",1
" Children go to Lewis Carroll in search of lunacy. But this soulless Disney contraption, a sequel to Tim Burton's hit Alice in Wonderland, instead offers child-psyche self-pity.",0

" Modest tonic, a bright and agreeable musical drawing on the boldly colored palette of countryman Jacques Demy and American filmmakers like Stanley Donen.",1

 There's nothing like a cleverly written bildungsromanic underdog makeover movie with the mother of all music-deity- laden soundtracks to Rock your world.,1
 Anderson's action chops are undeniable - but Resident Evil: Retribution might be one of the dumbest things ever crafted by human hands.,0
" It takes on the themes and universe set forth in the original and builds on them, and manages to live up to the massive expectations that greet it. This is no replicant, it's the real deal.",1
" American Animals plays out as a hall-of-mirrors examination of responsibility and memory, both of which are aggravated by the heedlessness of these entitled college kids...",1

 Howard simply isn't as good a filmmaker as Brown is a blissfully terrible writer.,0
 There's very little about the film that rings true.,0

" With unexpected success, Robert Altman plays a John Grisham mystery in a seductive new key.",1
" Fans of Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" will find much to enjoy in this sombre and nerve-wracking postapocalyptic horror film, directed and co-written by Jim Mickle.",1
 [Malek] is endlessly charismatic and somehow pulls off the physicality needed to approximate Mercury on stage.,1

" Watkins knows how to make a body jump out of its skin, even if he does use the face-reflected-in-the-mirror/window trick once too often. At the same time, the film is kind of, well, silly.",0
" Personality is noticeably lacking in director Steven Soderbergh's cotton candy caper confection that should, but will not, end his superfluous ""Ocean's"" franchise.",0
 fans will be thrilled to catch up with the gals. Non-fans will probably be a bit confused and wonder what all the fuss was about.,0
" For all his grimace-worthy view of humankind, Solondz is an eagle-eyed observer, and I think this is his best movie in years. Without him, the art of the feel-bad movie wouldn't be the same.",1

 A triumph of timeless artistry over transitory obstacles; its very existence is a secular miracle.,1
 The film eventually begins to work against itself and erodes the goodwill that it had earned.,0
" This is probably one of the best films Disney has ever created, it delivers on everything you'd expect from it and more. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Clear and Present Danger, like very few movies in contemporary Hollywood, has a very complex, yet interesting and compelling plot.",1

" Not a thriller by any means, Bhopal spends two-thirds of its running time following a few too many two-dimensional characters during the events leading up to the disaster.",0
" Hits all the marks you expect, but with few surprises and a protagonist that doesn't inspire empathy, Bleed for This doesn't go very far.",0
" When it works, the film possesses a rare exhilaration as timeless music and pure emotion fuse in perfect harmony. When it fizzles and falters, it is merely exasperating.",1
" Hunched over the handlebars, the boy's body seems to carve a hole in the wind. And we watch as this unhappy, rejected child makes some terrible choices, some of which make us want to look away.",1
" Coppola observes this giddy crime spree with her usual deadpan cool, finding satirical gold everywhere she looks. (Keep an eye out for Hilton's face on her own sofa cushions.) ",1
" We've never seen this before, multiple female characters open about ambition, power, and money. But representation alone does not make for a gripping tale.",0
" At its best, Hell Fest makes inspired use of its amusement-park setting, but it ultimately counts for naught when the plotting is this threadbare and the characters this insipid.",0
" Like a lemon that's been tricked out with a fancy paint job, Fast & Furious won't stand up to much scrutiny under the hood.",0
" Nemes once again follows another hollow-eyed and bewildered individual on a journey into a heart of darkness, but with less context, more plot and unfortunately, greatly diminished returns.",0
" The movie avoids many of the usual musical biopic cliches, but replaces them with an equally tired depiction of an innocent consumed by the wilderness she helped create, arriving at a muted, lethargic finale -- the antithesis of raucous rock 'n' roll.",0
 The updating is the kind of fanciful exercise far better suited to the stage than to the literal confines of the screen.,0
" [Magician] has an inelegant, cobbled-together feel that doesn't do justice to its subject.",0
" Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.",0
" Sometimes persuasive and sometimes sadly comical, but always fascinating.",1
" An interesting reminder of an earlier political debacle, Confirmation likely will confirm whatever biases a viewer brings to it: Hill was railroaded; the filmmakers are in the tank for Hill (those two positions are not mutually exclusive).",1
" It's a lot of twists and turns for very little reward. But bottom line, will the kids like it? Quite possibly.",1
 One ultimately settles into the usual slasher movie viewing pattern of not so much really watching than simply waiting for the next kill.,0
" The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a deft piece of fantasy filmmaking, exciting and engaging. Young adults and actual adults alike can enjoy it - it takes the format and makes it feel fresh, fun and even a little scary. ",1
" Thankfully, the screenplay doesn't portray the story in simple terms of good or evil but that doesn't mean that there's quite enough nuance or insight to constantly elevate the material above the level of a well-made but TV-ready biopic.",0
" Put a stake in this film noir monster movie, it's done.",0
" ...Hawn is undoubtedly bubbly and effervescent, and she pretty much carries this trifle, but her woman-child act is growing thin, even when she's apparently spoofing it.",0
" No one wants to let Eddie and his partner watch their kids at first because they are men, and of course men are only good at tweaking their cars to shoot flames from the engine.",0
 A powerful film. A great film. A messy film nonetheless. ,1
" Seems to last forever and, when it finally ends, leaves a sour aftertaste of overproduced, overblown schlock.",0
" Showcases stable, loving relationships (complete with supportive men), offers honest depictions of self-worth, and imparts a message of feminine achievement through the art of divine creation. Now how about that.",1

" A fantastically constructed, unrelentingly compelling look at one of the biggest ongoing injustices in American society today.",1
" If an animated scattershot clusterfuck tweaking under the influence of a determinedly Japanese mindset sounds like a good way to substitute a cinematic drug experience for the real thing, then go right ahead to Satoshi Kon's overflowing excess.",0
 A brainless gore-fest like Monster Party doesn't need so many steroid-enhanced flourishes.,0
" Even if it doesn't necessarily hold together as a coherent narrative and its mystery only makes a little sense, Kiss Kiss is a tremendously entertaining trip.",1

" So perversely jaw-dropping in its attempts to extort feelings out of us that it could almost be a black comedy. But no, this one is playing it straight.",0
" An accomplished coming-of-age psychodrama-cum-thriller with echoes of Carrie, Thelma unsettles and frightens. ",1
" Even with its stumbling nature... ""Call Her Ganda"" is still a valiant effort to fuse inquiry, testimony, heart and protest in dealing with its complex intertwining of facts and issues.",1
 Affair of the Heart's focus is so vaguely sketched out that it ultimately could be about any grateful artist who enjoys a modicum of celebrity years after his initial success.,0
 This satisfying comedy stands on the merits of its two leads and works predominantly because of Vince Vaughn's amusing performance. ,1
 The cinematography by Henri Alekan is simply astonishing in its spare yet lyrical quality.,1
" Parker has a sensitive approach to the crise d'amour, but his lacklustre leading ladies contribute to an uneven tone.",0
" There are only two reasons to see this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is drop-dead gorgeous, and the stunts, which are way cool.",1
" Although the new Miss Bala gives its lead character the agency to fight back and outsmart her captors, the film overdoses on its own message of pop feminist empowerment.",0
" You'll share George's sense of weariness as he searches for a simple night's sleep, but more importantly you'll believe in the cold world he inhabits, and the complex plight of those around him.",1
 The dog-human switcheroo isn't as straightforward as it should be,1
" Transitions back and forth from being a glorified play to a made-for-TV looking political drama, but well-meaning and educational",0
" Filled with the kind of humor and earnestness that [the last couple DC films] were criticized for lacking, Wonder Woman is an absolute joy to watch, thanks in large part to its two leads.",1
" The plot is entirely implausible, the end anachronistic and, even worse, positively offensive.",0
 The problem with this movie is that it's hard to figure out what Van Sant finds so fascinating about these kids.,0
" ...positive aspects are undermined by the bizarre rotating-actresses gimmick, which makes it impossible for the viewer to ever connect with [the central character].",0
 The typically moronic plot simply gets in the way of what might have been a super-ambitious sneaker commercial.,0
 It's all by-the-numbers stuff!,0

" Biller's visual splendor is ... wasted on a mediocre script riddled with structural problems. Scenes follow another willy-nilly, as if moved around late in the process.",0
 A film that approaches Cruise like it's 1996. Never settles into a groove and it's constantly suffering from an identity crisis.,0

" An engaging film, one which falls early in director Tim Burton's career, helping to highlight a remarkable decade's run of moody, quirky and goofy films.",1
" The movie offers three babes, a creepy old house and a malevolent possession all within a sumptuously crafted indie feature, so what the hell am I complaining about?",1
 I'm a tough guy; I can handle this stuff. That's not even a real alien. It's a puppet. Pffff.,1
 Preposterous and ridiculous!,0
 Little works in this tired production.,0
 This is Mater's movie. It's a Materthon. I would call it Materific if he didn't leave me longing for WALLE's robot to crush him into a silent cube.,0
" The film doesn't quite work. It has some choice moments, enough to carry us through, but it's difficult to build mood and tension with this kind of sprawling story and a large cast. ",0
" Ultimately, the film amounts to little more than a consummate study of suspense technique, all dressed up with nowhere to go.",0

" Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique, which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones.",0

" The heist is fun, but the detailed inside look at the workings of a speedway really makes Logan Lucky special.",1

 'Real life' as envisioned by folks whose idea of such was obviously cobbled together from the more backward examples of 1950s sitcoms.,0

" The film is channeled into the conventional and tearful through basic extortions: artery music, heavy alcoholism situations, accidents and farewells. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" Chicago 10, Brett Morgen's semi-animated, semi-documentary attempt to make the '60s cool for a new generation of kids, does the opposite.",0

" By convoluting the various planes of experience, by overlapping and obscuring ostensible realities and ostensible dreams, Mr. Nolan deprives us the opportunity of investing emotionally in any of it.",0

" Herzog has always shown a gift for immersing us in the startling extremes of the natural world, and his images here do not disappoint.",1

 It's sick. It's vile. It's deeply unpleasant.,0
 Youth lacks an emotional hook.,0
" With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart",0

" Gripping and yet very human, Everybody Knows is a whodunit that cares more about the how and why.",1

" Thomas Allen Harris's film offers a fascinating glimpse of the early campaigns of the African National Congress, and the way childhood memories can obscure larger truths.",1

" Much like an awkward but well-intentioned suitor, the movie inspires affection despite its overwrought script and occasionally clunky staging.",1
" Wyler's direction is heavyhanded (imagine what Lubitsch or Capra would have done with the romantic tale), but the actors (Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, and Eddie Albert) are charming and on-location shoot in Rome is major benefit even if the film is b/w.",1

" In making what one assumes is an anti-propaganda film, [Stevenson] and director Vic David actually kind of make a propaganda film.",0
 It's less the plot than the texture that makes the film such an engaging surprise.,1

 It's bedecked with religious themes and iconography that add up to little more than gorgeous window-dressing. ,0
" It's an Ealing-style comedy thriller, school of The Lavender Hill Mob, without much thrill comedy.",0
 It's a chronicle of blue-collar workers who depend on each other for emotional sustenance. A deep sadness lurks under the laughs. It seeps under your skin.,1
 The rare sequel so unexpectedly enchanting that it plays less like a rehash than a reclamation.,1

" Since seeing the movie, the thing I'm trying most to manage is my anger at not leaving the theater after 20 minutes of this inane drivel. Now, if you want to know what I really think of it, read on...",0
" If you're a person who cleaves to evidence based science, it's a hard film to watch because the scientific method takes a beating in all the emotional histrionics.",0
" Mannered and often very funny, it's kind of like what an Iannucci production would be if all his characters suffered from the behavioral effects of toxoplasmosis - really, really French, in other words.",1
" Surprisingly humane and even warm, despite these not being adjectives one readily associates with Seidl's work.",1
 None of this really hangs together. It is almost horrifying to watch someone as statuesque and strident as Streep cringing and mugging her way through a role this pathetic.,0

 It's all so cliched in terms of personalities and full of such unbelievable situations that it's often downright laughable. And not in a good way.,0

" The film is not without spectacle, but it is strangely without soul.",0
" Wayne and O'Hara create a fine rapport, with good performances that build to a truly satisfying climax.",1
" Hoffman really brings this Lannister Dodd character to life. He's a magnet, the kind of guy who walks into a room full of 100 people and he instantly gets everyone's attention. As always though, P.T. Anderson is the star.",1
" movies with ""Mars"" in the title tend to suck",0
 A tedious affair with little to offer other than a chance for your child to see a hugely forgettable romp.,0
" ... Starts as one thing, then becomes something else entirely.",1
" The story is a hash of beefcake mythology, the dialogue a steady dribble of earthbound utterance, the sword-clanging action a master class in un-excitement.",0
" Mellow and rich in ironic humour, the film carries an undertow of gentle melancholy; as so often with Ozu, its ultimate message is that loneliness is the human condition.",1
" What could have been a great, intense tale of betrayal, suspicion and romance ends up being a bit of a turkey.",0
" The gag-inducing melodrama ""Everybody's Fine"" hails from Kirk Jones, whose phone calls, kisses and hugs no longer will be returned the moment this baby hits theaters.",0
" Some movies were made for the big screen, some for the small screen, and some, like Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, were made for the palm screen.",0
" The Danish Girl is stunning to look at but rarely powerful to behold, technically accomplished yet also dramatically inert.",0
" Basically, it's a standard-issue Batman narrative - arguably better than 50 per cent of history's other Batman films - that just happens to take place in a Lego-fied world.",1
" ""Summer in the Forest"" is an extraordinarily tender documentary that asks what it means to be human. Here, even the most gentle scenes raise mighty questions.",1
 You'll never know how good the first three Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies were until you're forced to see the fourth one.,0
" An 'okay' movie with some very cool, colorful alien creatures.",1
" ""Zookeeper"" is a dud, even with the can't-miss kiddie catnip of talking animals.",0
" If the James Bond franchise people ever get creative and cast a female 007, Charlize Theron will have to be high on their list of possible candidates.",1
" ""Frantz"" is pleasurable slow going, developing its themes at an amble but with a measure of suspense, sympathy toward its characters, and a lasting faith in filmmaking craft.",1
" The director walks that line between comedy and pathos remarkably well, managing to inject comedy into a tale otherwise dark in nature - but it works as it's never overt.",1
" The most explicit organ in Blue Is the Warmest Color, believe it or not, is the heart.",1
" ""Sully"" comes across as an exhausted victory lap for Clint Eastwood. Give the guy his due. That still doesn't mean that he hasn't made a disappointing movie.",0
" The movie is a fairy tale, and writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral) knows how much the public loves a fairy tale.",1
 This is such an obvious black-ops ploy to milk the cash cow...,0
 Long-time supporters of the show will enjoy catching up with the eccentric characters. Others may be left scratching their head and wondering if this is the female equivalent of a Hunter S. Thompson novel.,0
" Relentlessly morose ... this labyrinth of a film is constructed recursively with characters playing other characters ad infinitum, ad nauseam.",0
 This is one of the best movies of the year.,1
 It's a nice diversion for undemanding and unsophisticated moviegoers who want to wile away about 100 minutes.,0
" When St. Vincent gets serious, it's pretty cloying. For some reason, the film withholds a lot of basic information about character identities so that it plays as a surprise when the relationships are revealed. ",0
" The Worthy boasts a gut-churning brutal streak that will delight hardcore genre fans, as well as some insane moral questions you'll be puzzled by for days (don't expect to look at a seesaw the same way again).",1
 It took an Oscar-chasing role tailored for Bridges to win him this belated respect; the movie itself is hardly worthy of him.,1
" ...a misbegotten, ineffective adaptation. ",0
 A real treat for the melancholy and music lovers. [Full review in Spanish],1

 A limp teenage by-the-numbers version of Rear Window.,0
" It's the story of a young married couple undone by a family tragedy, but the film loses its way, at one point turning into a political harangue.",0
" Tired teen fare full of drinking, grossout humor.",0
" Tom Cruise's ego-driven ""Look at me; aren't I heroic?"" performance detracts, but it's just too compelling and the other performances too pitch-perfect for this to ruin things.",1
 Both the movie and the hero are too relentlessly dour.,0
" The audience is left, then, submerged in two very different movies where the protagonists are going to sink or swim - but unsatisfyingly - not together.",0
" Dreary family drama goes on to dominate what could almost be described as the plot, and mid-film sorties into a cheerless sex club and a rugby match at an English secondary school are as bamboozling in isolation as they are in context.",0
" A fun hypothetical about what if every single thing went wrong and was turned against us? Probably not an accurate hypothetical, but a fun one.",1
 I love this movie. ,1
" It's not so much harrowing as it is repetitive, and the film gets stuck in a single gear it can't get itself out of.",0
 It's like being given the finger for 90 minutes.,0
 Suleiman's exquisite anguish is evident.,1

 It's as if [director] Schoelermann and screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor had more of a concept than a concrete idea.,0
 Fun horror-comedy about tourists being picked off in the swamps. Tongues are firmly in cheeks; heads don't stay long on shoulders.,1
" When an action movie is as clumsy as ""Man on a Ledge,"" it's begging to fall.",0
" In every other way, The Big Bounce is a dreadful exercise, with a script full of contradictions and empty gestures and a leading lady who's such a novice it hurts to watch her.",0
 Flush this one away.,0
" However thin, the story of these rootless youths, estranged from mothers and native cities, has a certain universality and appeal.",1
" It's a complicated trail that hardly seems worth following, and the cat-and-mouse game that ensues generates little tension.",0
" It would appear that in addition to robbing his brood of their need for blood, Carlisle also removed their balls.",0
 47 Meters Down is a floundering misfire.,0
 The film has social commentary but it doesn't distract from the narrative making it a quite mesmerizing portrayal of racial conflict and how even the most toxic people get free passes depending on their race,1
" It's a well crafted docu-drama-esque film that takes itself seriously, builds tension and scares the sh*t out of you through and through.",1
 The concept of humankind turning into one enormous mobile hotspot for use by an evil mastermind has legs. It's too bad Cell cuts the idea off at the knees.,0
" Movies don't need to have sophisticated plots, but they do need to make sense.",0
 so scattered and desperate that it's like a Stephenie Meyer aficionado on a speed date,0
 Roadside Romeo scores high on the tech front but considerably lower on script smarts.,0
" The apparent byproduct of watching too much Bad Boys II, The Viral Factor is a cops-and-criminals saga slathered in glossy Michael Bay-isms.",0
 A Christmas movie that would make old Bukowski's bloodshot eyes shine.,1
" while this elliptical, bleakly honest account of love's hangover years might not be ideal viewing on a first date, it offers uncomfortably familiar observations for anyone engaged in a relationship that is either long-distance, or just long-term.",1
" Overflowing with nostalgic visual treats yet falling short in terms of narrative substance, this coming-of-age saga falls apart in the final act.",0

" I kind of liked the film, I just wish there was a bit more meat on these very familiar bones.",0

 Prometheus is a prequel that works as a stand-alone but offers added benefits to those familiar with the Alien series.,1
" The minimalist approach and premise of ""Solis"" should work, but the execution in the script keeps the viewer disengaged, wishing the pod would move more quickly toward its final destination.",0
" Rarely has the phrase ""going through the motions"" felt more fitting. ",0

 The tolerance and loopy poetry of the beloved book by Dr. Seuss have been nicely captured in this CGI adaptation.,1
" ""Disobedience"" packs a punch and not one that you are fully expecting. Lelio's smooth directing palette is a welcomed addition to our cinematic year and one that should be admired by anyone who comes into contact.",1
" [It] not only aspires to change your life - it tries to explain it, from the first cosmic blip to those busy amoebae splitting and multiplying, to jellyfish jellying through the primal seas, to the planets lined up in a row.",1
" Seriously rich in suspenseful, subversive complexities about the roots of extremism - that should appeal to international audiences.",1

 Mad Max is Back. George Miller is an action-movie genius. See it in 2D!,1
 Old Dogs' astonishing lack of laughs remains its biggest deficiency...,0
" I wouldn't say it's Best Picture worthy, but I'll be mighty pissed off if it doesn't get some acting noms; #LarsonForActress (and heck, #TremblayForSupporting) begin now.",1
" The problem, then, arrives in the film's hurried final act, where a hitherto steady narrative gives way to an engorged twist that, whilst believable, insults the audience's comprehension of everything that has come before.",0
" Without the slightest sense of mockery, Steiner embraces the often-comedic details of their lives while revealing the ways in which they seem to have their priorities straight.",1
 Brave is easily the best animated feature of the year so far. But it's not a masterpiece. How dare they? Boo! Boo!,1
" Fun, fascinating, but a fawning documentary that avoids asking the tough questions or making the harsh judgements. ",1

" The lightweight story eventually runs out of gas and stops, but it provides little to take away other than some fleeting humor.",0
" As degenerate, coked-out DJ Frankie Wilde, Paul Kaye goes the limit, unleashing a gonzo performance that tilts between harrowing and hilarious.",0
" It is a depiction of a wondrous human experience, told with startling clarity. It's as close as any of us will ever get to that big gray rock floating far above our heads.",1
" It's a relentless film whose volume is permanently stuck at 11 - those that prefer their horror piercingly loud will love it, but milder ears may want to bring plugs.",1
" The performances have sufficient grit - and the writing has just enough polish - to make ""The Land of Steady Habits"" feel unpredictable and fresh.",1
" As it jumps back and forth in time, ""The Debt"" explores the conflict between expectations and reality, intellect and emotions, truth and regret.",1
" A passionless depiction of someone we never get to really know, much less care about.",0

" A tough, engaging, extremely touching work of cinema.",1
" In this case, boredom is the deadliest sin.",0
" It's hard to fault The Outsider too much though, as it will predictably fall into the black hole that is Netflix original movies, so here's hoping that Zandvliet, Leto, and especially Hjelm move on to better things in the near future.",0

" Barely an hour has passed since I saw it, and it has already been reduced to dust in my memory.",0
 Streep gets the basics but her performance beyond that is just as tone-deaf and filled with histrionics as the film itself.,0

 Ozpetek succeeds in portraying small nuances that demonstrate the stages of love -- unrequited or blossoming -- and in showcasing the family structure created by a group of people who have been rejected for one reason or another.,1
 Sicario is ultimately so obsessed with the minutia of its subject matter that it's often as engrossing as a day at the office.,0
" With its fantastic ensemble of characters and great sense of humor (not to mention an incredible soundtrack), it rises above the standard formula to make an entertaining and thrilling ride that leaves a lasting impression.",1
" A flat-footed, goofball international production with a global cast in search of a Roman relic, and also a definitive accent.",0

" The coda abruptly re-configures a tired crime saga into an altogether different kind of story, one that doesn't see redemption as something Roy might achieve for himself, but rather as something that he can give to the people who need it from him.",1
" Director Ceylan uses neo-Antonioni techniques for a plot which calls much more for Billy Wilder or the Coen brothers. Cinematography can only go so far. In the final analysis, you need dialog, plot and character development for a good movie. ""Three Monkey",0

 Lantana couldn't quite pull off being both a mystery story and a psychological drama.,1

 The nerve wracking film got under my skin without being entertaining.,0
" As a panel in the output of versatile helmer Scott, this prequel is detail-oriented but it's too serious, grim and verbose, posited between Kingdom of Heaven (a flop) and Gladiator, which while not great, offered pleasures that the new picture denies.",0
" Burton and his team have put style over substance here, resulting in an uneven and frustrating experience.",0
 The entire endeavor has a bitter aftertaste that frequently overwhelms the sensibility of mad spectacle that Fleischer and his performers strive to tease from the material.,0
" If Disney wants to bastardize children's classics by imagining what happened (later), the least they could do is show a little ambition and imagination.",0

" This is as straightforward a thriller as M. Night Shyamalan has delivered in years, and that works both to its advantage and detriment. And no, it's not an even split between the two.",0

" Graduation isn't one of Mungiu's finest, but even a restrained, emotionally measured work like this is more interesting and provocative than many another director's best effort.",1
" A very mannered but deadly dull period piece drama of partially upended, stuffy social customs, and a ruinous vehicle for the incandescence of Felicity Jones.",0

" There's little commitment to any particular tone - it never leans too far into idle B-movie pleasures, nor is the material elevated with nuanced character work.",0
" If nothing else, it's a pleasant reminder that if you haven't taken those Calvin & Hobbes anthologies off the shelf in a while, maybe it's time to go exploring again.",1
" This weeping ladydrama -- this cinematic doily, this chintz wing chair from a P-town antique boutique -- takes us to the oxymoronic world of WASP emotion.",0
 An experience likened to repeatedly playing with a Whoopie Cushion for an hour and a half...,0
" Go ahead, dance it out.",1
" Despite a rough start, ""Men In Black 3"" is still decent. It's mostly due to the likes of Josh Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg's fantastic performances along with Rick Baker's exceptionally creative creature designs, but the ending packs an emotional punch. ",1
" It's the take on the genre that Linklater might have made - sensitive, thoughtful and pointed, and willing to think about the kind of people who work at a restaurant where the food has considerably less appeal than the servers.",1
" True enough, Sorry Angel doesn't always make you feel the weight of its presence-but as any good romance should, it makes you feel the sting of its absence.",1
 There's a gritty integrity and plaintive poetry to this end-of-an-era western from Crazy Heart director Scott Cooper.,1

 Leaves too much time for Demme as he turns an interesting character study into a full-blown tribute.,0

" The big waves of Bruce Brown's famous '60s surfer movies like ""Endless Summer"" recede in son Dana Brown's piecemeal documentary about the 2005 Oahu North Shore Triple Crown surfing competition.",0
" There are some decent laughs here (especially for a well choreographed sex scene) and even an amusing soundtrack, but there's just not enough story to go around.",0
" Never quite as funny or as consistently entertaining as the show that inspired it, ""Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie"" is mainly for die hard fans. ",0
" Propulsive, beautiful and tense as hell, Tower is superior documentary filmmaking.",1
" A near-perfect balance of humour, pathos, adventure and poignant emotion. That makes it great entertainment for children and adults. The film is sophisticated, intelligent and heartfelt -- plus a ton of fun, too.",1
" Whether you're poring over the incredible detail of the images or losing yourself in the charming story, you'll want to keep your eyes on the screen at all times.",1
" The cast, especially Blunt and Bennett, turn in fine, layered performances, and keep the ""Train"" on its tracks. Even if you know the story already, it's well worth the ride.",1
" Talk about taking a step in the wrong direction. Peter Jackson, does your mother know what you've done? ",0
" What pushes this movie past ""dumb"" into ""reprehensible"" is its glib attitude regarding the consequences of its own images.",0
" It's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story.",0
 Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong.,0
 Every one of master Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda's movies breaks your heart in a different way.,1
" There's hardly a frame in this sour drama where you won't catch Streep ""acting."" Rolling her eyes. Gesturing wildly. Cackling. She might as well be carrying a shotgun the whole movie to fire after every sentence.",0
" As strange and intriguing as [Svankmajer's] previous work, the movie is also his most accessible.",1
 The Hunter is too many films in one...,0
" If you liked Clouds of Sils Maria, chances are you will be interested to see Olivier Assayas' latest film Personal Shopper, which offers Kristen Stewart once again a plum role, albeit in a film that struggles to make the grade. ",1
 The Eagle makes for an okay parent-and-young-son film outing. But you'll want to get your youngster the Sutcliff paperback.,0
" Using two actors to portray an artist at his creative peak and the wreckage left behind was an inspired idea, and the script...shuttles between these two eras, the 60's foreshadowing the ruinous 80's, which, in turn, informs the former's artistic stimuli",1
 A performance like Swinton's - so gorgeously and painfully calibrated - is something to behold.,1
" The result is an irregular film, with enough self-confidence, some blurred characters and situations... but which is in perfect harmony with the public discourses currently happening in Argentina. [Full Review in Spanish] ",1

 You're unlikely to find a more harrowing documentary this year than Diving Into The Unknown.,1
" As a story of the callous impersonalization we inflict upon one another, the film is timeless.",1
 A playfully unexpected spin on a historical drama.,1
" Surprisingly enjoyable, if not predictable.",1
" Now this isn't the most violent film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the only films in which the infliction of violence (gut-churning violence) brings people together. And to that I say ... finally!",1
" Delivers enough chills to do its job. The mayhem is presented sparingly enough to be suspenseful, some of the sequences are genuinely terrifying.",1
" The additions are okay; but it's the look that keeps you buoyed up, your eyes roaming the frames, laughing in surprise at the visual jokes and flourishes and textures. It's a dandy's movie, but that adds to the fun.",1
" I cannot say how faithful this is but, having read other McCarthy books, would say the novel probably repaid your attention with its astonishing prose. This, though, puts you through the wringer, but doesn't repay you in any way. ",0
" The derivative Rio 2 is a riot of color with groovy music, but not a single original moment to its name.",0
" A shallow, confusing, 2-1/2-hour slog through the life of legendary French designer Yves Saint Laurent.",0
" This film misses a chance to have a decent payoff, by possibly criminalizing a character we least suspect. ",0
" A silly, offensive movie.",0
 It's the absolute pits.,0
 So wistful it just about dissolves as you watch it,0
" Director Michel Hazanavicius and screenwriter Jean-Francois Halin have steered the film away from the coarseness of the Austin Powers movies toward something a bit more elegant and cinematic, though still shamelessly silly.",1
" In her own film, Nanny McPhee holds the impact of a day player.",0
 Plodding and lacking in logic.,0
 ...even if she was guilty Mary Surratt deserves better than this maladroit film that's rife with life-threatening boredom.,0
" Z is dramatically sound -- Robbie, in particular, is wonderfully understated and gentle and Ejiofor is consistently one of the best actors currently working",1
" This mash-up of alien and immigrant hardship, in which lonely Elisa finds sexual release with a sea creature, is pervy, ridiculous, and humorless. ",0
 It's worth remembering that most of the great surrealist films of the past were a good deal shorter than this. Less is more Jan!,0
 its dream cast makes its flaws easy to ignore,1
" It's all over the place, and it will make you laugh when you least expect it, but maybe not so much when you do.",0
" And pretension brings on a boredom so deep that -- like Lucy's dreamless, deadened sleep -- it sucks the thinking right out of you.",0
" All that emotion never quite manages to inspire the deep, resonant empathy these stricken parents -- and, more to the point, we in the audience -- so desperately need. ",0
 Gibson has basically taken the greatest story ever told and turned it into a snuff film ... It's Kill Bill for the churchgoing crowd.,0
" Silly and aimed squarely at the younger crowd, Captain Underpants has enough spirit to be entertaining. Just don't expect it to work all the time.",0
 Fans of the genre can enjoy the way it plays with horror's conventions. Others can just chew their fingers in fright.,1
 A sweet little film with heart.,1
" Entertaining enough with visuals to die for, but definitely not as emotionally rewarding as some of this director's other recent pictures.",1
 You can't put a price on a film-maker who still believes stunts should be shot in the street and not the editing suite,1
 Administers exhilaration without a Michael Bay level of enervation.,1

 It's unlikely that Miss Congeniality will stem the backwards slide of Bullock's career momentum.,0
 A would-be psychological thriller that manages to be both boring and goofy...generates tedium rather than tension.,0
" This potentially aggravating comedy remains sweet, smart and very enjoyable.",1
 Properly ghoulish fact-based anti-abortion snooze-fest/sermon that preaches only to the choir. ,0
" A breathtaking sequel to the futuristic classic Blade Runner, the film soars on the wings of its stunning visuals and moody score. It's stunning!",1
 Candor that has no substance beyond easy stereotypes is just depressing.,0
" ""Captain America"" fails to capitalize on the nostalgia of the character. Sure, cinematically he is treated respectfully, but it feels more like an obligation and chore rather than a labor of love.",1
 Paper Heart doesn't unearth the meaning of 'love' (spoiler alert?) but it at least shows us how real human beings deal with all those confusing emotions that might equal something close to it.,1
" Kitano has an enormous amount of fun goofing on Kurosawa archetypes, but here is a film with a song in its heart. (Yup, its a bloody samurai musical.)",1
" I've already reminded myself to skip ""Trolls 6: The Wrath of Chef.""",0
 The D Train can easily be distilled as a disjointed collection of irritating humor sprinkled over moments that seek-yet seldom approach-sincerity.,0
 Coogan walks that delicate line between being a character you love and a character you love to hate.,1
" Remember when Jude Law was cast as Dumbledore and we all thought it would pay off in this film? Well, think again. This is not much more than table-setting, and the boring kind at that.",0

" Even though it is a remake and everyone involved has tried to modernize the film and story, Red Dawn feels like an old fashioned, out of touch movie. ",0
 A devastating meditation on artistry and form.,1
" Kidnap is a shoddily-directed movie - filled with ADHD editing, ridiculous twists, and a tone that irresponsibly swerves between gritty thriller and Road Runner cartoon.",0
 Even earnestness and good intentions can't save Freedom Writers from feeling overly familiar. We've already seen this story many times in various forms.,0
" A dual showcase for colorful, albeit reclusive, late author Lee Israel and for Melissa McCarthy, who disappears into her potentially career-redefining dramatic role.",1
 I didn't care for the first one either.,0
" Stays true to its adolescent origins, more or less.",1
" The film shows that a ghost is able to move with secrecy and elegance, but lacks precision and clarity. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" The only thing that stops it from being completely oppressive is Greta Gerwig's wonderfully believable performance as the awkward, much younger woman whom Roger alternately woos and rejects.",1
" For those who favour a good old-fashioned ghost story, bristling with suspense, this film should be embraced with open arms.",1
" Those of us expecting the intelligent character development of Band of Brothers, The Pacific and even Saving Private Ryan will find this to be little more than a display of five archetypes in a tin can.",0
" Overall, A Man Apart is a carelessly clunky and protrusive production that feels as deep as a nostalgically naughty Starsky and Hutch rerun-only without the natural charm and genuine conviction.",0
" The film marks Michael Keaton's directorial debut and if this film accomplishes anything at all, its relative failure may finally inspire him to return to the day job from which he has been missing for far too long.",0
" There isn't a second that goes by without Ferrell filling it with some form of comic shtick - a well-turned punch line, a goofy facial expression, a pratfall or some other kind of physical comedy business.",1
" I suspect medical professionals would see much they recognize in this movie. The credits include a long list of technical advisers, but it doesn't take an adviser to convince you the movie is authentic.",1
" Eastwood's sluggish biopic fails to unravel the heart of this polarising character as it hops back-and-forth in time, despite a fiery and charismatic performance from Leonardo DiCaprio.",0
" It is a very compelling movie, despite the fact that the story hops around back and forth in its time line like a crazed wallaby.",1
" Very well-written, acted, and directed, this dark comedy pulls off a difficult stunt: making a deeply objectionable character interesting enough to follow all the way along her messed-up journey.",1
" The sad truth is that we've heard countless harrowing stories of the Holocaust, and this one, for the most part, isn't presented in a way that makes it indelible or urgent.",0
" This film will be a conversation starter for those that watch it, challenging the notion of gender roles and our culpability in reinforcing them.",0
" ...not much of a prequel, but it does provide more mindless fun than expected, especially when the scares are enhanced by the new immersive ScreenX format.",0
" A quiet and modest film with big subjects on its mind, that will reward those viewers with the patience to listen to the faint wavelengths at the end of the dial.",1
" The transplanted action cliches mix easily with the eccentric English characters, and as a director Wright is adept at framing and cutting for excitement as well as laughs.",1
 When your lead actor can't outact Ahnuld you know your movie is in trouble.,0
" An engrossing, quietly unnerving film that's one of the year's best...with an astonishing performance by Michael Shannon.",1
" Scott cares more about getting across an ideal of religious tolerance than recounting history - which is, in the long run, perfectly OK",1
" ...a movie built around dazzling dialogue, which makes it a rare and precious thing.",1
" More technically adventurous than Peele's debut, showcasing encouraging cinematic development diminished by a few iffy filmmaking habits.",1
" As grotesque and garish a spectacle as I've seen in quite some time, this Hindi remake of a coarse and unremarkable hit comedy from 1983 is cringe-worthy and puerile.",0
 Disposable and shockingly inept.,0
 Its greatest assets are its dazzling video game special effects.,0
 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is two-plus overstuffed hours worth of too many characters fighting for screen time that no enchantment can salvage.,0
" Although Carell is never less than likable, he's funnier in any random scene of The Office. Here's hoping some misguided team doesn't try to turn that series into a quick grab at box-office bucks 40 years from now.",0
 Yes it's a bit syrupy - but you only live once and I like lots of syrup with my pancakes. May you all live like you were dyin' and laugh so hard you cry.,1

 Get On Up is enjoyable...it's about funk and a funk legend after all.,1
 This one really IS moronic enough to be entertaining!,1
 The most disgusting and pointless movie I've seen. Emphasis on pointless. I spent half the movie sick to my stomach.,0
" The movie looks great throughout, blending action, urban drama and family melodrama with a dark, thrumming undertone that holds them together.",1
" The naked greed of capitalism can be an ugly sight, and with Disney it doesn't come much uglier than The Jungle Book 2.",0
" The journey taken by Jack/Edward as he walks among the stucco buildings, curving stairways, mountainous slopes and ancient architecture is meditative and dreamlike, an elegiac wanderlust.",1
 What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.,0
" This wedding comedy ought to be funnier and more lively than it is.There is, however, a good idea at its centre.",0
" Roos does find elements of truth here and there; frustratingly, there are too few of them.",0
" Ducournau, 33, is a promising, smart filmmaker with a lot to say, and ""Raw"" is quite a medium to present her ideas.",1
 Probably the biggest mistake McKay makes is in trying too hard to play into the material: he mistakes shaky camera moves and quick cuts for authenticity and a cerebral quality,0
 If a movie could have a jutting jaw and steely eyes Unbroken would be the prototype.,0
" Partly campy, mostly straight-ahead horrific and nearly always watchable.",1
" Cruelty, bloodletting and death are evident throughout (frequently occurring just outside the frame), and Griffith's laudable discretion actually intensifies their impact.",1
" Downey acquits himself well enough during the action sequences in 'Iron Man,' but there just aren't enough of them and the existing ones could use a boost.",0
" If the book is basically Fifty Shades of Grey for guys who have yet to discover their peckers, the film is a diverting slice of entertainment, offering enough surface thrills to justify its existence in a world already overloading on nostalgic feints.",1
" His sepia images of war's futility are beautiful, and Vishnevskaya's face is a compelling one, but they cannot compensate for the soporific anti-narrative.",0
" [An] absorbing, well-structured and superbly acted movie.",1
" Together Boyle and his co-director Loveleen Tandeen have created a portrait of a city in transition -- a place of relentless energy, of ambition and inspiration; of poverty and exploitation, of obscene riches and modest desires.",1
" Even the two fanboys behind me - who almost reached orgasm during the Speed Racer preview - laughed and yelled ""What?!"" when shown both a gimp and a medieval pit fight.",0
 Maybe this needed someone like Tom Wolfe to anatomise the proceedings fully.,0
 If only they'd brought Mr. Potato Head into the mix.,0
" Trust the Man is primarily focused on women trusting men, because the men find it nearly impossible to trust each other.",0
" Toni Erdmann is a film that surprises with its offbeat approach and its refusal to conform in its subject matter, its length, or its style.",1
" Emotional portrait of a frontman at the center of a horrific attack, but it doesn't feel quite complete.",1
" For a bad movie, this one is an awful lot of fun.",1
" The film is not a colourful one, with suitably muted cinematography and a sense of realism many such stories eschew. Maybe that's not the best news for the box-office but it makes for a more intelligent movie of the genre all the same.",1
" ... deft/daft mix of authentic feeling and sharp parody, belly laughs and visceral dread, makes Tucker & Dale vs. Evil a keeper... ",1
 I feel like a Sparkle Baby just puked rainbow-colored dust all over my head. ,1
" Inherent Vice isn't everyone's kinda trip, but it is righteous fun for those who enjoy the high.",1
" Drillbit Taylor is second-rate Apatow, but it still outperforms most teen comedies.",1
 Everything that happens after the first 80 minutes or so falls so flat you can see the actors wincing.,0
" The Thing is a masterpiece: a black comedy, monster movie, conspiracy thriller and whodunit.",1
" Not even Ms. Witherspoon can save it. It is, however, high time she started thinking about saving herself -- and what's left of her film career.",0
" This is a film meant for more mature youngsters, teens and adults and is best viewed on the big screen.",1
" South Korean cinema contributed the summer's best action film with Train to Busan, a kinetic kick of a zombie thriller. Tunnel doesn't quite do the same for the disaster genre, but it's a well-made, suspenseful and surprisingly moving twist on a formula.",1
" The movie plays like an exhausted hallucination, disjointed and frustrating, much of it owing to the lack of chemistry Gondry allows between his stars.",0
" The stylishly grimy ""El Clan"" asks but never quite fully explores one overriding question: can anyone be innocent of complicity in a crime when they heard and ignored the screams coming from the basement?",1
 Should be shown on screens large and small wherever quality docs find a home.,1
 It's frustrating that a director as talented as Duncan Jones comes up short with his first turn at a big budget movie.,0
" With a million times more computing power at its disposal than its 1982 predecessor, Tron: Legacy still looks like Disco Night at the jai alai fronton.",0
" Cradle 2 the Grave feels like about four different movies working at once, all of them stylized, none of them making much sense and maybe a couple of those being even slightly entertaining.",0
" Decorated with sumptuous costumes, arresting sets and breathtaking cinematography, rarely is a film both this visually stunning and this emotionally stimulating.",1
" The script is very sparse. It feels like an outline, a general idea rather than an actual filled-out story.",0
" An outlaw saga of undying love distilled to its emotional essence, as if it were something to be inhaled or applied to the skin, to work at the level of the blood and bypass the cynical defenses of the intellect...",1
" Good action fun, with spectacular stunts and special effects.",1
" Though the plot here may be a confusing, multi-threaded mess ... it's occasionally offset by the exuberance with which Black blends splatter and slapstick, and the leeway he grants his two very game leads.",1
 A total waste of time and talent....,0
" Two valid readings of the relationship between Joi and K instantaneously begin when she lights a drag of his smoke, and within that paradox is the heart of the entire Blade Runner universe.",1
 Need for Speed is just another pileup in Hollywood's long accident report of taking games from the couch to the theater seat.,0

" Clarke and Claflin have palpable chemistry, and we are no more able to resist Lou than Will is. ",1
 Among Offenders' other successful elements is a trio of terrific central performances from some exceptionally well-cast young actors.,1
" Rarely boring, but not half as smart, funny or subversive as it clearly believes itself to be.",0
" The worry with a movie this crammed full of characters and incident will feel rushed and/or incoherent, but that's not really a problem here.",1
 An absorbing and intelligent mixture of history lesson and forbidden romance.,1
 Halfway between a good Coen brothers movie and a terrible Coen brothers movie.,0
 [A] polished biographical drama ...,1
" That the film itself never attempts to achieve more than the humor enjoyed by 12-year-old boys may make it ironic, but it doesn't make it funny.",0
" There are more thrilling ways to spend 88 minutes, like counting from one to 5,208.",0
" Inversion feels like a neo-realist movie. The settings appear tangible and authentic. The actors disappear into their characters. There is no soundtrack, just the noise of radios and ringtones.",1
" The filmmakers have a vision of the way Shakespeare can be made vibrant and vital to modern viewers, with or without the lofty original dialogue.",1
" World War Z is rotten to the putrid core, which is amazing considering the amount of writers that had a chance to get this story right. Man, I'm not even going to bother with a zombie pun on this one.",0
" One of the most graphic, scary, funny and imaginative depictions of drug addiction ever filmed.",1
 Call Me By Your Name is a film made with great care. [Full Review in Spanish] ,1
 Writer/director Guillermo del Toro puts too much effort on image and not enough on background.,0
 A party where everyone is so desperate to have a good time that it makes you miserable.,0
 ...a deeply funny film that still manages to grapple with some heady emotional territory.,1
" Its premise is battling the tone throughout, a fight that neither side ends up winning. A cacophonous, sporadically entertaining mess.",0
" ""Jodorowsky's Dune"" is a lovely little tribute to a major league ""What if?""",1
" This sweet story that has been put to film shows the passion Cartwright found for the 1954 Fellini film ""La Strada"" that started a three-decade journey that resulted in the story of what it means to be deeply passionate about something.",1
" It's short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat), and the film's niceness can't overcome the dopey tedium.",0
" ... 'Gimme the Loot' isn't the kind of film where a lot happens, but that's it's small-scale magic ...",1
" The story begins well and keeps your attention for the first 30 minutes, after that point begins a decline that leads you to an appointment with Morpheus. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" Remarkably formulaic and technically sufficient, In The Fade sternly guides its audience through a parade of misery in an attempt to be politically relevant",0
 One of the most underrated films you will ever see. ,1
" Ambitious? You bet, but also a towering, tumultuous folly. It's the movie equivalent of a prog-rock double album, short on humour, long on pomposity, and as for what it all means - you might well ask.",0
" 9 Songs is certainly a cinematic oddity, a pop-punctuated romance with the pink shots left in.",0
" It's a screed, sure, but a fun one. And Christian Bale is astonishing.",1
" Most of the plot was about as thrilling as an episode of ""Wheel of Fortune.""",0
" Inspiring if overly familiar story that owes its allegiance not so much to history (it alters many facts) as to Dead Poets Society, Hoosiers and countless other ""carpe diem"" flicks.",1
" If this modest charmer doesn't finally make a star out of Steve Zahn, I don't know what will.",1
" More disgusting than scary, The Ruins is the latest in a long line of horror films about upper-middle-class travelers being terrorized in unfamiliar environments.",0
 Essentially a celebrity goof-off ... Hit & Run goes slack from the lack of any real back-and-forth.,0
" The Day After gets by on the farcical nature of its entanglements-in moments, it plays like a delightful comedy of misunderstanding.",1
" What Men Want tries to do far too much, and much of it is too much of a distraction from the stuff that does work.",0
" An astoundingly senseless thriller featuring Nicolas Cage, Nicole Kidman, and a band of masked goons. (The word thriller is used very loosely.)",0
" For a film that claims to have so much heart, it all feels suspiciously hollow.",0
 The Crash Reel is an affecting reminder of how suddenly circumstances can turn on us. But it's also an inspiring look at how we can deal with even the most hobbling bad luck.,1
" Damon, who carries a certain blankness and anger with him, is right at home playing people who don't quite fit in and are tying desperately to find where they belong.",1
 ...a hopelessly corny romantic comedy that boasts a myriad of jokes and gags that wouldn't pass muster on the hackiest of sitcoms.,0
" The deadly combo of leaden animation, sorry scriptwriting, and limp pacing throttle every attempt at humor.",0
" A loving ode to the American wheat belt, told with lashings of candour and wit.",1
 Idiosyncratic portrait of an oddball whose enthusiasm for making movies is endearing.,1
 Flavorless piece of sci-fi hackwork.,0
 A two-minute romantic problem that takes two movie hours to resolve.,0
 A fun homage to the 1987 original that's every bit as explosive and exhilarating.,1
" Saoirse Ronan is stunning, carrying herself as regal as a woman can be, stretching her terrific acting chops as a woman whose judgment in men is not always on the money.",1
" Boyle's film takes us back to the campfire for a story that is painful and powerful, as well as true.",1
" Despite the 3D visuals, there is nothing about this film that is cool or innovative.",0
 A crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most.,1
" Bell is, as she has proven over and over, almost impossible to dislike and it is sweet and charming to see Pegg playing as close to a regular adult as he possibly can.",1
" Cleaving to a child's-eye-view of a time of significant social change, documentarist-turned-feature director Julie Gavras elicits excellence from Kervel as the stubborn schoolgirl struggling to deal with the lack of certainties in her new lifestyle.",1
 The film's lackluster story and older than dirt gags -- it makes The Flintstones look like Shakespeare! -- keep it from reaching the outer limits of enjoyment.,0
" If you're a Martin Lawrence groupie, Rebound fulfills your appetite for all Martin all the time. But if you're seeking laughs with a story that moves, well, this is no Coach Carter.",0
 It's a richly conceived treat.,1
" ...despite being like some sort of Frankenstein's monster, made of different elements taken from superior stories, the movie never bored me. [Full review in Spanish]",0
 One of Disney's greatest triumphs.,1
 Affleck balances the labyrinthine plot with pulse-quickening suspense and vivid production design.,1
" This may very well be the 90-year-old auteur's final film, and if it is, it's the perfect way to come to an end: with a glance to her past and a focus on all the wonderful people there are still to meet in the world.",1
 Director Andrei Tarkovsky has mixed daring with poetry in making this film: he shows the Soviet hero as an individual troubled with the doubts and complexities of other humans.,1
 I cannot remember when I've been this incredibly bored by a movie. Put it this way: I had the devil of a time staying awake -- and I saw a matinee. ,0
 Trainwreck is a welcome breath of fresh air and the emergence of a brilliant new voice.,1
" The best moments come when Robb's all-purpose toughness experiences vulnerable doubt. These moments are flickers, but they're bright and human.",0
" ""Button"" ends up being an eloquent and moving tale that keeps all its lighter and darker elements in near-perfect balance.",1
" There are no pods to be found here, other than the one off-screen into which the better judgments of most involved here must have been stuffed. If Nicole Kidman doesn't watch out, she'll awake to find her career replaced by Meg Ryan's.",0
" There's some cool plot points provided by otherwordly expert J.K. Simmons, but they quickly get lost in the shuffle of a boring movie that feels all too familiar.",0
" A little more tweaking for the actual actor's voices to come through, instead of trying to put them into pre-concieved places, may have worked better, but on the whole, it's still an excellent example of how the ensemble comedy should work.",1
 This Sugar doesn't blend the sweet with the bittersweet as deftly as it might have.,0
" This is pure pulp pleasure, the cinematic equivalent of great beach reading... and what better way is there to describe the work of Elmore Leonard?",1
" The visual magic of the story, as well as some enormously welcome glimmerings of humor, gives it the solid feel of a well-tended franchise.",1
 Sporadically intriguing yet mostly unwatchable...,0
" Final Portrait is quiet, patient, thoughtful and at times really funny, with a meditative quality that the engaging actors slip into effortlessly. ",1
" There are few things more cinematically painful than watching a cast work really hard to make you laugh and fail with consistency. That's the experience that Killing Gunther offers, and it is a rough watch.",0
" Simon Pegg's new movie is a gem, and his performance is like nothing he's done before.",1
" It's tough to be too hard on In & Out, because Rudnick's script is so often so sharp.",1
" The Loft is a film that can't decide what it wants. It's a male fantasy, and a cautionary tale. It's sleazy in concept, and timid in execution. It punishes its protagonists for their transgressions, then lets them off the hook.",0
 Methinks the kids to whom this superhero movie will most appeal won't be able to separate the stereotypes from the political wishful thinking.,0
" It unfolds with clinical precision, its historical truths revealed in sequence without any real dramatic stakes.",0

 Surely it's only coincidence that the sign of D'Leh's accomplishment is a White Spear.,0
" The film purports to tell a heist story, but it is utterly lacking in logic, tension or intrigue. And it ends in a way that resets the bar for ludicrous.",0

" McQuarrie's entire roster strains the limits of character likability to the breaking point, and no amount of plot twists, double-crosses, or hidden alliances can help us relate to or even tolerate anyone on screen.",0
" It doesn't get much crazier than this portrait of one particularly crazy love, which, for all the operatic thrashing about, fails to amount to all that much.",0

" With honor, the documentary team led by Todd Douglas Miller have now echoed this monumental achievement with an artistic one of their own.",1
" It's a little bit V and a little bit Lethal Weapon. A little bit ""1984"" and a little bit Rambo. It's got sledgehammer political satire, humor, goofiness and little bit of Wrestlemania thrown in to boot.",1
" No samurai armour; no suicide garden; not much really of Fleming's bizarre, obsessive travelogue.",0
" It unfolds a little too slowly, perhaps. I could see where this film was heading from very early on, and, well maybe I just wasn't in the mood for an updated, French provincial version of Noel Coward's Brief Encounter.",0

" Although inspirational and thought-provoking, 'Wild' is gruellng to watch. But powerful performances by Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern won me over completely. ",1
" Capturing the stress and tension of the job detail, as well as the emotional toll on the officers, the line between audience and actor is blurred as the camera alternates between their perspective and that of the audience.",1

 One of the best things about this film is that it shows there are people out there who have hope and the determination to turn that hope into action towards an achievable goal.,1
" An action film starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever looks like a video-game promo, has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show, and feels like a headache waiting to happen.",0

 Women are the heroes that can save humankind.,1
 The draw is spectacle and on that score director Yimou Zhang and his crew more than deliver. ,1
" A thoroughgoing deconstruction of humanity as well as heroism, one that takes its world apart without putting it back together again. There are things to admire here, but Watchmen doesn't make me care.",0
" Given that the movie starts out in such interesting fashion, it's hugely disappointing to see it devolve so lazily into a generic vigilante fantasy.",0

 an intriguing crime saga that is long on atmosphere and short on momentum,0
" ""Pieces of April"" too easily wraps up the lifelong conflict between Joy and April in the end, but there is a good-natured feel that makes it an amiable little holiday film.",1
" It's rather classic Disney. I think it's perfect for young kids in a lot of ways, except that it's rather dark.",1
 The reason The Wedding Plan rises above its flippancies is not only because of the novelty of its Israeli trappings but also because Michal is such an ingratiating whirlwind.,1

 A smash-and-slash affair. This probably bodes well for the franchise but ill for those of us who think the world would be a better place with at least one less conflicted comic book antihero glutting the megaplexes.,0
" This faithful adaptation of the classic Dr. Seuss story is perhaps Illumination's best achievement to date, with amazing visuals and great voice acting. The hilarious jokes and positive messages add to make this the perfect Holiday film for the family",1
 It's an over-ambitious pop culture spread that should please hip-hop history buffs and absolutely delight those with a healthy distaste for authority.,1
" The nihilism even carries over to the product placement, as when a case of Skyy Vodka prominently appears in the foreground while a club-goer overdoses.",0
" Even at 83 minutes (plus a three minute cartoon) it's a drag, another 3D movie for kids in which the 3D adds nothing, merely subtracting from parents' wallets.",0
 The film often feels like a ghost story narrated by the ghost himself and works best when it is visually more impressionistic. Images of empty rooms and landscapes are far more evocative than the Cobain stand-ins the filmmakers occasionally deploy.,1

 Bad acting butts heads with bad-ass action.,0
 This Chris Columbus film is as painfully unfunny as any movie this summer %u2013 or in recent memory. A chimp could have written this script...goes from grad to worse.,0

" Wind River reveals itself to be a full-fledged message movie. This shift in tone, while not surprising considering the cartoonish villains and muted sentiment, goes against the film's natural instincts.",0
" Hilariously funny from beginning to end, ""I Love You Man"" will always be remembered as the film that launched Paul Rudd onto the ""A"" list.",1
" Ann and Kong's romance drives the film. At once sensational and heartrending, it's an intimacy that can't last. ",1
" Touching and responsibly presented, the film shows the meditative, intimate power of the documentary format.",1
 This is far from a sophisticated movie but the simplicity of the story allows it to have a lot of fun playing with the outrageous characters and silly sight gags.,1

 A tense and nasty black-box thriller that conveys its politics through the microcosmic stakes of its life-and-death scenario.,1
" Director Cuaron may lack imagination in plot and character, but he excels in style.",1
" Despite its talent, 'Broken City' is an unremarkable film. Soon enough, most everyone will forget about it. It's not 'Chinatown.'",0

" This wannabe Sherlockian thriller is like a night spent at Madame Tussauds, watching mannequins strangle other mannequins.",0
" Comedian Katt Williams, in a small role as a chipper hitchhiker, injects about 15 minutes worth of fun into Father Figures, an otherwise mostly dreadful road comedy in which Ed Helms and Owen Wilson play twins searching for a man to call dad.",0
" Where The Girl on the Train distinguishes itself, though, is in its forthright presentation. With unbearably over-the-top performances and direction, in addition to an unfocused purpose underlying the story itself, it is an almost unwatchable mess.",0
 Bottle Shock takes a fascinating historic event... and renders it as a sidelight to an overindulged father-son conflict and story lines that start out well but never go anywhere.,0
" Few debuts come punchier, cooler, and more influential than Louis Malle's 1958 thriller about a Parisian murder plan unravelling, scene by fateful scene.",1
" Aronofsky has messed with you so much, giving you so little to hold onto that by the end, when he wraps it all up in a bow, it's too late. ",0
 Performances keep the tension building toward an incendiary climax.,1
" While it doesn't leave you as breathless as Malick would like, The Tree of Life will stir your soul and make you think. Which is an outcome every moviemaker should aspire to create.",1
 It's undeniably thoughtful and impressively crafted by the talented Bier but its pair of parallel storylines don't live up to all that Oscar hype.,1

 A warm portrait of a much-loved singer.,1
 Dickinson is breathtaking.,1
" This might have been a pretty good kidnapping story, but writer/director Asghar Farhadi goes soft; he slows it down to the point of almost stopping it and emphasizes goopy, over-the-top soap opera. ",0
" Uwe Boll would be proud of this movie. It's pretentious and oh-so-serious. The tone of the movie is one of high art, but it stinks like a landfill.",0
 This is just the movie for two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level.,1
 Insidious: Chapter 2 is not only unnecessary but it commits the cardinal sin of devaluing its predecessor.,0
" A love letter to a city should at least be so in love with its location that it sweeps you off your feet and makes you want to go there. ""Berlin"" fails to make a proper case for Berlin.",0
" Weighed down by a shallow premise, cringe-worthy gags and mixed performances, this ends up one big, boring disappointment.",0
" As a children's fable, the film lacks magic, due to Weitz's uninspired helming and uneven technical execution, but it's likable, moderately engaging and well-acted by Dakota Blue Richards and Nicole Kidman; too bad Daniel Craig has such a tiny part.",0
 An unexpected charmer.,1
 Guiraudie wants to have a little sport with the irritation that comes with a creative block -- but he can't quite make art out of it.,0

 An overlong and slightly pretentious indie effort.,0
 The idea remains more absorbing than the final product.,0
" Director Eberhardt does nothing to elevate this from being anything other than a boring TV movie, and I'm sure if Kurt Russell wasn't in it, that's exactly where it would have premiered.",0
 The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone.,0
" Transcendence is a big-idea movie, the kind to cause spontaneous salivation in science-fiction fans. But big ideas don't always fit neatly onto the big screen.",1

 ..hands down the funniest movie of the year to date ,1
 [E]xactly as cozily silly and as charmingly touching as you'd expect from a nation that gives medals of valor to birds.,1
" Though Wyatt's allegory is clear, it doesn't drown the story itself. Even the most thinly drawn character has purpose and dimension, the ensemble talent assembled here delivering memorable but understated turns.",1
" Kidd says he wants the extras to act as a 'film school in a box,' but the overall effect is more 'it takes a village,' indie-style ...",0
 A spine-tingling adventure guaranteed to elicit blood-curdling screams and to make you jump out of your seat when you least expect it.,1
" The movie has so much clutter and gratuitous sparkle that it feels like something from Elvis's closet: a grand cape outfitted with gold, silver and femme fatales - but serves no purpose whatsoever. It just hangs there.",0
" [Isabelle] Huppert delivers a captivating performance, even as the film's shift in tone slides toward the absurd. ",0
" All of these adventures call on Rodriguez's fascination with visual effects, which could be tough on his human cast, but he has the wit to keep them in focus. All up, it's good fun.",1
" The best that can be said about the acting by the witches is that it is, well, bizarre. And rarely funny.",0
" I love a good western, so I am not very enamored with Appaloosa. I guess you can say I just want to be friends with it.",0
" If you ever wanted to see a kid in a knife-fight to the death with a blood-thirsty tiger, Mowgli is the film for you!",1
 A strong first half gives way to genre predictability.,0
" This sappy romantic fantasy proves that a movie doesn't have to be a CGI extravaganza based on a video game, comic book or toy line to be inordinately dumb.",0
" To be an audience-grabber at the heart is not always a pointless concept, and here the director and writers prove that the formula still has a few kicks to it.",1
" In the end, Mean Girls isn't mean enough.",0
 Blumhouse's Truth Or Dare is the first great dumpster fire of 2018.,0
" Under writer-producer-director-editor Patrick Hughes, the suspense level is high and the action constant.",1

 It maintains the same level of quality as the first one. [Full review in Spanish],1
" The film asks down-and-dirty questions about what really resides beneath thousands of years of human progress, a savage and haunting antidote to the high-minded idealism of movies like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Ridley Scott's The Martian.",1
" It's the performances that stay with you, and the two young first-time-actor leads are a revelation.",1
 Any film that sees Professor X downing a yard of ale before chatting up girls down the pub has classic written all over it.,1
 This whole nauseating enterprise smacks of the basest exploitation.,0
" American Honey is a great movie, or at least there's a great movie in there somewhere. But for some reason they decided to make this great movie and add then five billion things on top of it. ",0
" An utterly gorgeous visual delight, and it has some enjoyably goofy moments, managing to throw in some left-leaning, anti-elitism socio-economic subtext for good measure. ",0
 It's all right without being particularly riveting.,0
 The Nanny Diaries ultimately feels emotionally true to itself.,1
" Maybe it's all the rain and leaden skies, but instead of conjuring up the rueful mood it's after, the film mostly just plays dark, wet, and heavy.",0
 A gripping story of survival on the streets and survival of the soul.,1
 Somehow the film provides a uniquely realistic look at the effects of war while the plot does its best to cloud our view.,1
" Fun ghost story, awesome monster, and Jessica Chastain dressed as Joan Jett. What more could you want? ",1
" I certainly came out of Nobody Knows feeling numb; only later, reflecting on the fact that the movie was inspired by a true story, did it occur to me that the numbness could have been deliberate, and that what suffused this picture was a mist of anger.",1
" The screenplay by David S. Goyer is like an arm wrestling match between brain and muscle, and when one takes charge the other falls out of line.",0
" Jenkins' brushstrokes of her characters are too exacting to move us more than a lifelike painting of a basket of fruit. We can be awed at the techniques, but walk away empty.",0
" Duchovny's tone shifts in this seriocomic mess are mishandled, so that the comic parts aren't funny and the serious stuff elicits inappropriate laughter.",0
" More than changing the genre of the cast, Feig's Ghostbusters it's an explicit response to the franchise director's sexism. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" They're hot, they're married, and they're trying to kill each other.",0
" There's something unsettling, even creepy, about the kung-fu tournament...they fight like they're trying to emulate the violence of the more graphic martial-arts videogames.",0
" Holness' film - which also has an old school element in being a rare modern horror shot on 35mm - never feels derivative, and part of its slow burn terror is just how dangerously unpredictable the whole thing feels. ",1
" The Lost in Space TV show had devolved into camp after its first season, but though the movie remake takes itself a bit more seriously, it doesn't give us much of a reason to.",0
" Rude, crude and lewd. As nasty as it is naughty. Savagely satirical. Sexually disturbing. And absolutely for adults only. Most of that is a good thing.",1
" Give the Spierigs credit for finding an interesting way to free themselves of the shackles of the zombie genre, if only for a little while.",1
" It's cool to see a movie that doesn't feel the need to make everyone likable, but the four credited screenwriters here don't manage to make anyone worthy of our sympathy",0

 Glass is silly and dull when it should be thoughtful and tense.,0
" This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over.",1

" Are you sick of superheroes? No, of course you are not, cinema audiences are lapping up any caped crusader movies. But I am, especially when Tony Stark is an angst ridden shambles suffering from performance anxiety. What's so super about that?",0
" Though the title ironically appropriates Jesse Helms' Senate floor admonition during the art-funding uproar over his work, it also acts as the simplest of incitements.",1
 [McQuarrie] spreads a unearned veneer of intelligence over...a plot one character aptly describes as 'grassy-knoll ludicrous.',0
" How awfully, strangely death can void a personal identity. The filling-in of the chalk outline remains sketchy, as Morley well knows. This docu-obituary's sharply aware of its own bit-ness, its partial-ness.",1
" Moodily shot on monochrome and accompanied by an industrial soundtrack, it already seems these hardmen belong to a different, rose-tinted era.",1
" More outlandish and much less successful than several previous incarnations of the Arthurian legend, Guy Ritchie's reimagining is full of sound and fury, signifying, well, nothing.",0
 Like watching something that's always on the verge of being a movie.,0

 A sublime comedy with an emotionally rich texture.,1
" The film eventually lurches wildly out of control, abandoning certain characters completely and leaving others stranded in inexplicable plot holes.",0
" Even if Allen's own past didn't loom over the film's narrative, Wonder Wheel wouldn't rank among his best work",0
" [Director] Antal's slickly edited, fast-moving style is the best thing about this otherwise-cliched movie.",0
" It's a film that takes itself a little too seriously in an effort to be intellectual, but you'll enjoy it more if you don't. ",1
" You Don't Mess With the Zohan is like a hellacious bad-hair day -- unkempt, unsightly and mildly embarrassing at best.",0
" The fact this complex, energetic and wholly entertaining film is a debut feature film is stunning. Raw is a gory gem of a film that you have to seek out.",1
" It has enough atmosphere and rhythm to achieve a pleasant, even chilling experience. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" This Hollywood-level suspense thriller never goes where you expect it to go, but often gets bogged down in over-exposition as the plot thickens... and thicken... and thickens...",1

 Doesn't punch nearly as hard without Coogler in its corner.,0
 Kleiman seems less interested in explaining the whys of his scenario than in observing his characters and their interactions -- a strategy that pays off thanks to excellent lead turns.,1

 Nuanced performances that ring so true you can't help but become emotionally involved in their lives.,1
" ""A shameless Oscar-bait"".",0
" The Change-Up has lots of guy stuff. Porn, nudity, language, booze, busty babes, drugs and urinating in a fountain. What's not to like? The plot maybe?",0
 ...Liman is also clever enough to make the real action start when the motor stops.,1
 Ron Frank and Melvut Akkaya's documentary suffers from an approach by turns scattershot and schmaltzy.,0
" Full of sparkling dialogue, witty asides, and top-drawer performances, Mansfield Park is a social satire wrapped inside a romantic comedy.",1

 You'll be on the edge of your seat....until it stops,1
" In a season of endless comic book superheroes, Hellboy II is a unique visual feast.",1
" For a movie about terrorism and the way government spies on its citizens, ""Closed Circuit"" is surprisingly yawnsville. ",0
" ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a smart comedy about people, their foibles and the enduring strength of relationships.",1
" [Captures] the wild, primal emotions at the heart of society and show that well-ordered republics -- and families -- run on passions that are hard to accommodate or tolerate.",1
" There's no 'back to basics' here, it just gets even more insane. They haven't quite gone to the moon yet, but it's getting there.",1
 Zain Alrafeea's charisma and the sharp direction from Nadine Labaki elevate the film. [Full Review in Spanish],1
" As edgy female wish-fulfillment fantasy, showing that fantasy's consequences, ""Adore"" engrosses and engages and never titillates with even the tiniest hint of revulsion.",1
" Had a script been written, I'm confident that we could have had a great comedy on our hands.",0
" While Otto demonstrates a good deal of passion for his project, it isn't matched by a similar level of creativity.",0
" Everyone, including Madrid, looks terrific, but Deception delivers on no other level, except perhaps as a guide to various New York hotel rooms.",0
 The Tall Man comes as close as anything in recent years at matching the better monster-of-the-week episodes of The X-Files.,1
" The fourth installment, a prequel designed to explain the series' origins, feels like a culmination of its consistently undercooked social commentary, somehow serving as an equal-opportunity offender without managing to entertain anyone.",0
" A respectable swansong for the late Claude Miller, who passed away just weeks before it premiered at Cannes. ",1
" With Welcome to Marwen, director Robert Zemeckis, as he has so often in this stage of career, focuses more on the visuals of a story instead of the why of it.",0
" You watch helplessly as the movie goes off the rails, the suspense and excitement leaking out of the enormous tension the early scenes had generated. ",0
 The humour is British - low key but often barbed - and the filmmakers manage to control the tone of the film through the many elements of the human experience from love and art to death and broken relationships. ,1

" As far as low budget horrors go, Bloody Ballet is one of the better films on the market. A wonderfully twisted blend of stunning visuals and terrific performances, it also serves as a great showcase of Brett Mullen's ability as a director.",1
" The Brothers Bloom distills elements from films by the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson down into a wholly original, and hilarious, caper.",1
 Curiously flat and unrevealing.,0

" ... the last time I saw a genre film that felt like this much of a stick-the-landing home run was 'Shaun Of The Dead'... a smart, visceral sci-fi parable.",1
" Breaking a Monster is simultaneously uplifting and depressing, and if it lacks a third act, it's only because Unlocking the Truth's story is still playing in the real world.",1
" The youth's pain is palpable, and the film will stir viewers still wounded by that day and those who have suffered loss in general.",1
" Amiable. Bland. Cute. Formulaic. Inconsequential. Run Fatboy Run goes down with ease, but it's awfully slight.",0
 Crowe seems unable to layer up the story's sentimentalism with anything subtler than an industrial dumper truck. ,0
" Glass is now the second-least-impressive title, after The Last Airbender, in Shyamalan's canon. Sigh.",0
" What saves Matchstick Men from being a complete washout are the performances by Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman.",0
" Like the first film, this is basically a generic buddy cop movie and an episode of Miami Vice fused together, towing a trunk of old boring ideas and pointless camera tricks.",0
" I find myself reflecting not upon the hilarity (of which there is more than enough here), but upon how desperately sad so much of the film is behind the booze and boob jokes.",1
" White knuckle past the point of bursting a blood vessel, the basic premise of Don't Breathe flips the home invasion formula on its head, decapitates it, and ravages its lifeless corpse. ",1
" While you've got to admire the chutzpah of a feature documentary that declares its bias by only showing half of a decidedly two-sided story, the downside is that...the constant repetition of arguments and pounding of rhetoric can become wearying. ",1
 One of best in the heist genre I've seen in some time.,1

" In its own way, it's an involving picture, but Malick's form is too frequently working against his content.",0
" Given the show's niche roots and the movie's ephemerally entertaining wispiness, the elevation of the series looks to be more swan song than rebirth.",0
" It'd be nice to report that Glass is over-flowing with promise, or that Shyamalan has once again found his groove, but the truth is that Glass is...bone-dry. ",0
" Isn't as unwatchable as other similar movies, but it's still pretty deplorable and offensive.",0
 Anderson proves himself a bold stylist with his dark and colorful tale of the rise and fall of a makeshift family of L.A. porno stars and auteurs.,1

" One of the most self-indulgent, muddled, badly written, vague and pointless exercises in filmmaking I have ever had to sit through.",0
" A threadbare attempt at a frightfest--dumb, turgid and ultimately tedious.",0
 [Van Houten] is so good in it that it seems only a matter of time before she'll star in a real Hollywood movie -- as opposed to this pretender.,0

" A hectoring, simplistic affair that has nothing of value to contribute to the British debate.",0

" It's strictly a side issue whether mankind will survive colliding with an asteroid the size of Texas; the real question is whether Liv Tyler, who plays Bruce Willis's daughter, gets to keep her boyfriend.",0
" The Italian Job is the movie equivalent to a big beach novel: It's light, it's entertaining, it will keep your attention and it's no big strain on the brain.",1
" Just when you think you've had it with this movie, there comes a farcical, rock 'n' roll sort of comedy sequence, or a hilariously goofy line.",1
 Clooney is trying to push the merit of the material a touch too much; a fact betrayed by the amount of times his character ventriloquises the film's two main morals.,0
" A bit like a medley of greatest hits performed by a hot, young talent who brings a new vocal inflection to the tired, old standards.",1
" ""Cloud Atlas"" is a film where the creators' admirable reach exceeds their grasp. You may be getting six films for the cost of one, but it may not really be worth the price.",0
" As far as preposterous pulp is concerned, Angels & Demons is livelier than The Da Vinci Code. But it's still just preposterous pulp.",0
" Room is a sensitive and even uplifting but very realistic psychological drama about abuse, depression, courage, and a lot more, even if the story of its inciting situation is terrifying, especially for women.",1
 This might be Mud. But it deserves to stick.,1
" Blending the tepid romanticism of a made-for-TV biopic with the most tedious political drama this side of The Phantom Menace, Arash Amel's screenplay is suffocatingly dull. ",0
 Predictably whimsical and lightweight.,0
 Nothing detracts from the quality of the ensemble's performances. All the actors capably express their inner-most feelings about their happiness in each other's company and the fearfulness of being a person of colour in America. ,1
" While acknowledging its flaws intellectually, I was still emotionally thrilled.",1
" Does not quite get to the social contradictions of New York that have turned it into a theme park for hedge fund magnates, but it does serve to show how big capital was fought by Jane Jacobs in the early 60s. ",1
 Spineless people slowly falling in love is painless to watch. 'Something Borrowed' now stands as proof of this. ,0
" This movie has a truly uninspired premise and wallows in so much inanity that it might as well have been buried in the catacombs, too.",0

 A very funny French comedy of a variety that usually doesn't make its way here.,1
" At its first showing in a public, non-specialised cinema so many people fainted that it had to be taken off. Well, here you have it red and juicy and over-lifesize as ketchup. Who wants it? Someone, I suppose. ",0
" The muddled concept is forced to the point of breaking, the writing overheated and the story arc grimly perplexing.",0
" Broken simply can't get it together on any level, delivering a tedious drama, that for all the characters and over-emoting, doesn't have much to say. ",0
 Writer and director Celine Sciamma adorns the thorny dilemma with resonant allusions to gender roles...,1

" It won't make anyone want to go back to the 80's, but it might make them want to see Grace's next film. ",1
" Gore Verbinski's direction seems to sway whichever possible way will get the most reaction at any given moment. It's a movie of whim,...[a] hit-or-miss dartboard variety of whatever goes, goes.",0

 Flashy musical numbers go a long way to disguise the bitterness of this pill.,1
" The script is written in a clumsy and primitive way, a pattern that gets worse as each scene goes on. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
" (Like) Bill Murray's Lost in Translation, Hologram's strongest quality is its focus on an eminently genial character, uncertain of his future, his feet sinking (this time literally) in the sands of time.",1
" The boys are great, and the relationship between brothers who have been thrown together because they share the same absentee father is the film's truest, sweetest element.",1
" The sort of mistily pretty literary adaptation where everyone speaks in complete sentences pregnant with imagery and meaning, and where historic events serve largely to try the souls of the characters, who in turn try the audience ...",0
 Hits all the right buttons of a satisfying end-of-the-world yarn.,1
" A desperate violence and urgency spills out in the film's flash-point set-pieces - not least a sensational car chase, shot through a windscreen, hammering rain and a blur of fear.",0
" With Creep 2, you're never truly convinced the narrative is going the way you think it's going, and while that may be frustrating to some, it's enchanting for those looking for one good scare.",1

" ...an insane document, a slice of life that we probably should never have seen. But now that we have seen it, it's too late to deny its crippling poignancy...",1
" Becomes one big yawn of uninspired battle sequences, half-baked plotting and ultra-clunky dialogue leading to a lame, tacked-on coda.",0
" The film moves at a stately pace, but that just makes it cumulative effect all the more powerful. Time had its way with Dawson City as it has its way with the rest of the world, but there's much to learn, and beauty to see, in what's been left behind.",1
 Crisp if feather-light ...,1
" Sleight is a strong feature debut for Dillard with great moments that tend to pick up the more humdrum bulk of the film. It's definitely uneven, but the glorious, jaw-dropping climax is worth the price of admission alone.",1
" The story is dull, and many extended jokes never find a punchline.",0
" It's doom that we're meant to feel here. And repulsion. I hate to say, but I shrugged.",0
 This militantly appalling horror film offers so much to complain about that it hardly seems worth taking offence at its interpersonal politics,0
" Liberation doesn't have quite the same effect when it's done by white people, for other white people.",0
" If you fixate on funny things like plot and character -- in movies, anyway -- too bad.",0
 The Space Between Us is what you'd get if you hit John Green between the eyes with a ballpeen hammer and then demanded that he rewrite Stranger in a Strange Land.,0

" And here it is, ladies and gentleman, an entire 90-minute movie primarily set inside the cramped confines of a phone booth.",1
" Edina and Patsy are like Lucy and Ethel in the chocolate factory, only replace the chocolate with cocaine, eternal-youth fetal-cell injections, bolly (champagne) and cigarettes.",1
" Despite any faults, or double faults - which also includes some dialogue that sounds suspiciously like too-meaningful speeches - Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining, well-performed history lesson in the sociology of the early 1970s.",1
" The film is funny, even though it is difficult to relate to kids who live in a world that is so far apart from the norm. The movie does finally connect, I think, because of the love story that underlies the rest of the plot.",1
" Maybe there's no way to pull it off. Instead of trying to make something meaningful out of its mound of plot material, The D Train retreats into the warm embrace of cheap laughs.",0
" Just as the film seems primed for a self-pitying, cheap-shot conclusion, there's a liberating set-piece of fumbling group adventure that achieves a mythic, cathartic quality.",1
" Not a great film, something to watch when it comes on cable, not for a night out to the theater.",0
" X-Men doesn't really know what it wants to be: a camp-fest, a super gay love story, a celebration of '60s comic book style, or a semi-solemn treatise on learning how to accept and celebrate diversity.",0
" In the rare instances where That Never Happened personalizes the consequences of the internment camps the film soars. Unfortunately, those moments are few and far in between.",0
" John Malkovich saves Dark of the Moon, the Transformers franchise, and the very concept of the effects-driven summer movie, but he is sadly only in the film for about ten minutes.",0
" Good, but not great",1
" The movie, directed without a personal stamp of any kind by Chris Columbus, is so slick that the grime comes from a spray can and the grungy bohemian costumes look rented from a Betsey Johnson boutique sale.",0
 The inclusion of an engrossing (yet expected) finale ensures that The Wave ends on an exceedingly positive note...,1
 Where it fails is in its sense of scale. It's definitely not an epic. And it's not a great film. But it's a good one.,1

 A film that sticks to its fidelity but causes total disinterest if one is not a fan of this saga. [Full review in Spanish],0

 American audiences looking for female-led dramas that are authentic by design need only seek out this impressive film. ,1

 What fun! Not really.,0
 Didn't have enough heart for me to find its soft spot.,0
" It's as if Branagh, fearful that his artsy reputation precedes him, has gone to the opposite extreme and low-balled the material.",0
" Tiny Furniture is a comedy of youthful confusion that gets its kick not only for evoking a world of unromantic hookups, casual BJs, and iPhone porn, but for satirizing New York's bourgeois bohemia.",1
" There's a pleasing tension in the air as their relationship comes to seem like something of a contest: With two women this needy, who will out-crazy the other?",1
" Whitney: Can I Be Me is a harrowing, uncompromising, beautifully crafted portrait of the deeply flawed pop princess.",1
" The sort of movie where characters aren't so much developed as merely designed and then plainly labeled, defined solely by physical appearance and descriptive monikers.",0
" Hey, if endless degradation and sadness are your cuppa tea, then click on Mudbound.",0
" This is a movie that tries to emulate much better stuff...without bothering to come up with anything new, and all leading to a single destination: the setup for a sequel.",0
" Undeniably, the word ""action"" does apply, but only as it falls between ""class"" and ""suit.""",0
 The Oslo Diaries provides an even-handed approach to the 1992 Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.,1
" Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby might not reach the dizzying heights of Fitzgerald's novel, but he gives it a damn good shot, old sport.",1
" The original 1951 film carried a timely anti-nuclear message, but this film wouldn't dare offend anyone by even mentioning the phrase ""global warming.""",0
 Kevin Spacey redeems his performance from K-PAX with a patient story of a man's finding his life.,1
" Bigelow's camera is impartial and dispassionate, but explosively powerful and unflinching. There is no commentary or judgment, just war and fatigue.",1
" It's only gradually that Assayas allows his self-penned script to open the comedy throttle, overlaying this strata of ideas with cute, smart, sexy comic strokes, without ever quite undermining it.",1
 A feel-good bit of fluff for the senior set....A pity it never takes any chances or goes beyond the obvious.,0
 Cinema of the eternally pubescent hits a new low with director/co-writer Edgar Wright's adaptation of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel. ,0

" [A] hodgepodge which veers from segment to segment with remarkably little logical connection, even for a kidflick.",0
 Best known for launching the underexposed Grant's career. And for being severely overrated.,1
 The script just seems to be a mix of cheesy parts of other films and the cast is a random mixture of actors and actresses thrown together as some sort of cinematic experiment. ,0
" Jack and Jill isn't awful or particularly successful. It is, however, the curiosity piece expected, totally undemanding and just bizarre enough in concept to keep one's interest up.",0
" It may start with a big burst of energy, but this is a sad, somber film about a world that's slowly, knowingly losing touch with the real.",1
" Despite Black's reputation as a comedy anarchist, the movie has a big heart, avoids crude indulgence, and gives viewers of all ages something to enjoy.",1
 Mr. Popper's Penguins is a stupefying dumb family movie proving that penguins have limited charisma as pets.,0

 The melding of a modern family saga with the Nativity is too awkward and hectic to let audiences sit back and appreciate some powerhouse singers and music.,0
" Aloha is a mostly bad, uneven film with hard-to-know characters and a baffling premise.",0
" It's a small, compact, tightly written picture, shot in richly expressionist tones by Robert Elswit and guided by an exquisitely judged lead performance.",1
" Writer-director Jonah Hill's hip-hop ""Tom Sawyer"" tribute to his rough SoCal childhood may be one the year's best. Great ensemble cast.",1
" I'm as much a fan of big-dumb-fun movies as the next man-child, The Meg is mostly just big-dumb.",0
 [Kong: Skull Island] feels like a movie that was made in a focus group chemist lab and never solidifies an identity.,0
 This sci-fi tale can't find much of an identity outside of its great visuals.,0
" Overstuffed but underwhelming, 'Infinity War' is burdened with too many characters, too many battles, and an ending that is meant to shock but is obviously a cheap trick.",0
" The Monuments Men is okay, if you don't expect too much from it. It's a fine rainy-Saturday movie. But shouldn't we expect more from our art?",0
" Wearing an ill-fitting top of insincerity matched with clunky, hypocritical heels, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is in dire need of a makeover. ",0
" A layer cake of cutesy romance, fight-for-your-dreams earnestness and a syrupy score.",0
" Should have stopped at three. Four, no more.",0
 There's something slightly queasy-making in how this film summons the tireless piety of a church-recruitment pamphlet to describe what basically amounts to Burning Man as a business model. ,0
 Think of it as My Cousin Cosmo.,1
" It's sick, stupid stuff, and intentionally so.",0
" Red is a goofball lament. It's saying that in the good old days, or at least in the good old movie days, our killers were good-time guys.",1

 It'll keep you amused enough to sit still and even remember it fondly. But it seems a light day's fishing for Messers Cleese and Palin.,1

 It's not awful - you just wish they'd made a proper movie out of it.,0
" Dead Men Tell No Tales hasn't the faintest residue of piratic thrill. It arouses no joy, no sense of daring. The prevailing register, instead, is indifference -- the bone-deep dispassion of mediocrity.",0

 Blackhat is a difficult movie to understand.,0
" A decent, well-crafted film, but ultimately more workmanlike than inspired, though one has to commend its commitment to authenticity while regretting its periodic lapses into domestic melodrama.",0

" Subtle and insightful at first, and sweetened as it approaches to the end, the film, directed by John Crowley, benefit from the impressive performance of Ronan. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
 This anxious comedy wobbles like a retread of Annie Hall.,0
" Neither uses the most popular and primitive Gaul humor as its model, nor does its melodramatic part have that exacerbation present in 'Instructions Not Included'. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" Crudely animated, tasteless, and totally pointless, which I'm sure the filmmakers would say is the point.",0
" Small indie that has all the ingredients of a typical Hollywood Meg Ryan romantic comedy from the 1990s, including Meg Ryan, but lacks the spark of the best of her genre.",0
" It is grown-up, respectable and historical, perfectly competently made, lots of accents and period dressing-up... and just the tiniest bit dull.",0
 Ben Wheatley might one day make a film of interest as long as he nails down a few particulars before heading to the set.,0
" Directed by Jodie Foster with zippy panache that elevates the sometimes witty but tired and contrived material, ""Money Monster"" makes few heavy points (even though it tries) while scoring as a smart thriller. Call it 'Broadcast News' with a bomb.",1
" Never as shattering as Pixar's best and most brutal. In fact, it's almost subtle. But it's the kind of film that dares you to undermine it, just so it can whack you upside the head and steal one more tear.",1
" Certainly, the production values echo those of high-end made-for-TV fare, but the cast and amusing script more than make up for what the movie lacks in gloss.",1
" You can surrender to the skill of the filmmaking, and the nuanced performances of the ensemble, but nonetheless it's not an entirely convincing picture. It doesn't get a grip on you.",0

" With superb performances from its stars, Villains is the black comedy thriller that is sure to stand out among the crowd.",1
" It's handsomely shot, filmed with a crisp, chilly edge and plenty of natural light. But the visual realism locks horns with a ruinously predictable - and increasingly silly - narrative.",0
" Reportedly 10 years in the making, Blindspotting is a refreshingly original, gritty and stylised version of the typical rites-of-passage story.",1
 This didn't just work for me as a film... it feels like an experience only barely survived.,1
" Originality isn't the film's strong suit and Sammy's adventures never come close to the escapades of Nemo, but the 3D certainly earns some points with the ocean brought to dazzling, spectacular, colourful life.",1
" That the 2015 version isn't as riveting as the 1982 feature isn't really a problem. But the new ""Poltergeist"" doesn't even best 1988's ""Poltergeist III."" That's cause for concern. ",0

 Dramatically unconvincing and morally unsatisfactory.,0
" [The Hateful Eight] is what you'd expect and hope for in a Tarantino film, but by the edgy auteur's barometer, it's a lesser cut.",0
 This sequel is as sour and jaded as they come.,0
" While the viewer may sympathise with McCandless's saintly rejection of materialism and his pursuit of eternal truths in a mapped-out world, there's little irony in the film, and the deluded Chris never actually helps anyone else.",0

" Don't miss Menemsha's latest jewel, a comical clash of outlooks, pitting a self-assured sisterhood against a bewildered, backwards brotherhood. ",1
" A gripping documentary filled with vivid eye-witness testimony from a country where violence is commonplace, corruption is endemic and life is so cheap that it can be terminated for as little as ten dollars.",1
 Tom Hardy is brilliant in what's essentially a one-man show. ,1
 The built-in suspense and poignancy is compromised by an awkward structure that tries to juggle too many disparate narrative elements.,0
 Another movie for fans of rude/crude humor,0
 There's plenty of visual whimsy in the late-19th-century setting - the animators render a gorgeous Paris - while enthusiastic dance sequences and comic beats balance out melodrama.,1
" Ambitiously conceived and skilfully edited, this is an impressive achievement on several levels that's by turns moving, funny and awe-inspiring, though it's also a little too manipulative and over-produced in places.",1

" Artfully constructed and deliberately paced, making up for the many ludicrous twists and turns it takes.",1
" It's intended to puzzle us -- and sure, the little puzzles peppered throughout the film are fine. It's the grand non-sequiturs that are distracting.",0

 Tidy and informative ...,1
" If ""House of Sand and Fog"" ultimately feels like a failed exercise, it has less to do with Perelman's limitations than with a book that would have been better served by staying on the page.",0

" There's a reason Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were done as two movies, not one.",0
 A muddled film that takes a standard urban action movie and adds a veneer of overwrought romance.,0
" There is no great payoff or grand reveal. There's just the cold, icy sensation of being in the presence of a known man who appears to be unknowable.",1
" A spectacular mash of half-baked ideas... Well, that, and a movie that just got lost somewhere in the editing room.",0
" A brave film, and a surprisingly absorbing and finally affecting one, partly because it's about that least American of trinities -- silence, solitariness, and the spiritual deepening impossible to achieve without both.",1
 An agreeable balance of emotions and laughs.,1
 This franchise has gotten aggressively unsatisfying.,0
" These bodies, whether human or zombie, feel room-temperature at best.",0
" There are other good performances, including a small one by Peter Sarsgaard as Fischer's chess trainer, but overall this is a film in which, as the end credit documentary footage attests, the real story overwhelms its dramatization.",1

" It's about looking envy and pettiness in the face, laughing at those qualities, and then shuddering out of uncomfortable recognition.",1
" The movie is effectively one long, well-choreographed action chase sequence. It isn't very interesting, or for that matter, particularly coherent.",0
" Every single scene is an abominable assemblage of mind-boggling stupidity, completely unmotivated behavior, and unfunny slapstick.",0
" This weekend, millions of people around the globe will be conned into handing over their hard earned cash to see a film with no plot, no action and no climax.",0
" With Keaton in devastating overdrive, Moore can barely exercise her own brand of ginchiness.",0
" 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', 'La Femme Nikita', 'Kill Bill'... this South Korean thriller owes a debt to many a great female-assassin thriller, and it's a fun ride for fans of the genre. ",1
" The only thing this Avengers shares with its swinging, earlier incarnation is a London setting.",0
" Maybe fashioning it as a trilogy with ""Shaun"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" wasn't a great idea since it leads to comparisons it can't possibly live up to being such a different movie.",1
" I wouldn't call Vox Lux a bad movie by any stretch ... [even though it] ignores a promising premise and concludes in a pedestrian, if artful, way.",1
 The jokes are fresh and more often than not manage to produce some big laughs.,1
" In a way, Freddy finally makes sense in this version of Elm Street, but Robert Englund's original Freddy is still preferable to Haley's pervy Groundskeeper Willy. ",0
" What keeps ""The Fountain"" from being a really great film is that it's so heavily based on the visual and pretty effects ... the idea of a simply told story gets lost in the shuffle.",0

 Krampus is ultimately that rare thing -- a potentially really good movie undone by one glaring Achilles heel.,0
 It's a film of small details rather than big gestures...and all the more powerful for it.,1

" As we come to the midpoint of J.K. Rowling's tales, it may have finally turned the page for the better.",1
" Cruise will never win an Oscar for playing Hunt, but what he does in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is surely at least as taxing as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio's role in The Revenant, with the added obligation of making it look like fun.",1
" Even as you struggle to keep up with its speedy chatter and multi-character complexity, Brick is always entertaining.",1
 [Robert] Rodriguez has made stuff like this work by demonstrating a healthy sense of self-parody. Hughes has yet to master that.,0
" There's nothing mind-blowing or exceptional about The Return of Xander Cage, but it's certainly above the standard quota of January movies.",0
 It is a beguiling fairy tale that mesmorises.,1
" Paradoxically absorbing, yet cliched and empty, this power-based New York story is a bit of an entertaining thrill ride, probably far more popcorn-engrossing than it deserves to be...",1
" Its downfall in the end is that the film offers more quirkiness than charm, but that quirkiness does have its appeal.",0
 The most exciting science-fiction space adventure ever made.,1
" Baffling ending notwithstanding, a stunning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in a film that won five awards (of a total of fifteen) from New York Film Critics Online.",1
 It's a well-constructed story that does not require any cinematic flamboyance to make its point.,1
" The film is filled with humor, compassion and cajones, and never once glosses over the fact that these guys are prickly personalities who can sometimes act like jerks.",1
" A true classic. Lancaster at top form, Curtis is great as his toady. A cynical masterpiece.",1
" As fresh as the female perspective is, as Skate Kitchen circles and swoops through the Manhattan twilight toward its conclusion, there is a sense of missed potential, that there are better stories to tell that were missed in the rush to drama.",1
" It's another horror film where the metaphor had potential, but there's not really any parallel between what's happening in the story and the real-life phenomenon it's dealing with.",0
" Choosing not to emphasize the romantic angle, the film feels more like a pilot for a television sitcom than a movie.",0
" Sensitive, insightful and beautifully rendered film. One of the best of the year.",1
 So can we somehow make a bargain with the film world: no more Anna Kareninas? You're making idiots of yourselves.,0

" I didn't like it, not at all, and while I'm certain there are kids out there who will undoubtedly feel differently don't expect me to sing a different tune on the matter anytime soon.",0
" Highly superfluous, but equally entertaining. Terminator fans, we got lucky with this one - I doubt we'll be so fortunate when the aging Arnold eventually creaks his way through T4: HIP REPLACEMENT DAY",1
 the movie is at its best when it plays with the various ways in which Ferrell's genial awkwardness constantly sharpen the razors in Wahlberg's eyes,0
 The film finds a delicate balance between the somber and the fun. [Full review in Portuguese.],1
 The filmmakers show they are especially adept at pulling off some tricky animated 3D effects.,1
" Really, really funny!",1
 In a way it seems like a parody of a [Paul] Greengrass film: His cameras shake and the music swells but the narrative is stuck in neutral for a good hour-plus. It's all herky-jerked up with nowhere to go.,1
" The actors are all charged up, too; there's just nowhere in this script for them to go.",0
 Above and Below is a work of slick artistry but at the cost of something truly transcendent.,0
" No melodrama, no thriller twists, just Trapero's camera sticking to his lead actress like sweat.",1
" Well, there goes my dream of driving across Australia.",1
 American Reunion is the worst slice of pie yet. All of the jokes are ten years too old and none of the serious dramatic turns amounts to anything.,0
" While the lackluster drama includes Hemingway, it's more about a Hemingway fan.",0
" What the story lacks in innovation, the film makes up for in sheer loveliness, performed by a thoroughly engaging cast.",1
" Marked by a strange lyricism, Sharunas Bartas makes an uneven film. [Full review in Spanish]",0
 Even the title card is garish,0
" The series continues to move away from the depth, realism and magic of the original, but as a diehard fan of the franchise, Fallen Kingdom still offers up a satisfying ride set in this franchise.",1
" You're left with the sense that Brand might yet be the subject of a great documentary, but he'd probably have to be on the other side of the planet while it was being made.",0
 Crispin Glover is Willard. . .take delight biting into this tasty slice of horror cheese.,1
 Unrest is an unflinching look at a disease that overwhelms both the stricken and the medical community. Brea gives viewers a first-person look at the harsh realities of CFS. ,1
 [Pixar's] first feature to lack the winsome pizzaz that makes for mandatory repeat viewing...(but will still) entertain enough to justify the price of a movie ticket.,1
" As Winston Churchill might have said, never have so many done so little for so many with such dreary results",0
 A game cast and a talented writer-director elevate this confused slasher flick above its generic blandness.,1
" So bewitching as a romantic, charged & aesthetically slick star vehicle that it's easy to overlook its shakier aspects. Has adult summer blockbuster written all over it.",1
" Parnassus is a step up from Gilliam's two previous pictures (the ineffectual The Brothers Grimm and the torturous Tideland), but it still feels like a cobbled collection of ideas and conceits rather than a stand-alone story.",0
" ""Live Cargo"" is one of the most evocatively shot debut films in recent memory, which is why its shabby storytelling is such a crushing disappointment.",0
" While the movie was fun and entertaining, don't believe the advertisements because the film may have one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen.",1
 There's nothing wrong with a one-joke horror/comedy -- provided you keep the joke spinning for 90 minutes. This flick (somehow) does.,1
" At once stagy and cinematic, 'Hairspray' blends the old-fashioned power of singing and dancing with the elixir of forbidden love.",1
" The Bad Batch is expertly constructed and looks great: Amirpour has presumably been inspired by Alma Har'el's documentary Bombay Beach, and has picked up the same atmosphere of bone-dry decay as well as using the actual place as a location.",1
" Plods along its bumbling, good-natured path to exactly the conclusion you expected before you were handed the ticket.",0
 The force of Cahill's personality draws you to the screen and rivets your attention.,1
 Valuable ... but misses a golden opportunity to intersect access and art.,1
" Even when it's difficult to grasp exactly what it's trying to say in some of its more head-scratching segments, the film commands appreciation for its vision and audacity. You might not see ghosts the same way again.",1
" A down-and-dirty revenge picture whose classy cast elevates it above its gritty, grimy trappings.",1
" I'm all for filmmakers reaching out of their comfort zone, but what's with this insistent attraction to scummy, sweaty lowlifes? Does allowing your crotch to be shown in an unflattering position make you A Serious Artist?",0
" The charisma of the cast is tremendous, it's still a breezy and adventurous heist movie, and particularly in the performance from Hathaway, it's timely, in its way, just as its predecessor was.",1
" Despite poignant source material and timely issues, The Switch is a formulaic, verbose, predictable romantic comedy, lacking wit.",0
 Leigh has earned this masterpiece through the Turner school of industrious application.,1
 Obsessed with two insignificant musical acts.,0
 Southbound strives for unity and mostly succeeds.,1
 Grandly entertaining.,1
 The point here is not to depict Reagan-era corruption or cartel ruthlessness. The point is a wild ride akin to [the real-life] Barry's own - you may as well enjoy it.,1
" This is the sort of nostalgic, dreamlike family film parents and grandparents will find -- perhaps more so than their offspring -- perfectly pleasant viewing.",1
 The Disaster Artist is just a total delight. ,1
" A confident blend of performance, kineticism, and tone, it has a pulse all its own, born of passion and curiosity, and a healthy dose of psychological mystery to boot.",1
" [Lemon] has some legitimately peculiar traits, and moments that flash with true absurdity. But there's a flatness in the end-result. The quirky is utterly predictable.",0
" Disappointing threequel with a badly written script, irritating characters, dodgy CGI work, a miscast Maria Bello and an underused Jet Li.",0
" Shipenko has created a claustrophobic and unrelentingly tense experience, further heightened by gorgeous cinematography, strong effects work, and a stirring score.",1
" A fetid, overlong drama laden with bizarre subplots and an inexplicably star-studded supporting cast, built around the dated idea that standup comedians can, indeed, be jerks.",0
" The mark of a good actor is being good in a really bad movie. Josh Brolin is a really, really good actor, because most of the time he's on screen speaking you can almost forget what a loathsome, irredeemable, turd of a film Jonah Hex is.",0
" Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can't turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will.",0
 Saying that Scary Movie 3 is better than its predecessors isn't exactly high praise...,0
" Highlighting the inexplicable beauty in nature while presenting his young characters with ravaging existentialism makes for an alluring, tense, beautiful experience",1
" It wants to be politically incorrect, and indeed there are many rants against women, insults to visible minorities, and general verbal mayhem. But you get the sense the movie never means it: this a Hollywood lesson in redemption.",0
" Although it doesn't have Kate Beckinsale, her guns ablazin', vamped out in the latest vampire-slaying couture, Night Watch is vastly more fun than the similar-themed Underworld pics.",1
" Caro knows how to push viewers' buttons, and she does so every chance she gets. The weather in the movie might be chilly, but she makes sure our blood is boiling.",1
" Collette, as amazing as she can be when given something to work with, can't lift this limp story through sheer will.",0
 The makers... demonstrate a genuine integrity for their series by reigning the story back in to its original core elements... Fans of Saw will not be disappointed.,1
 Harrelson doesn't have enough character to ground himself in this one.,0
" Almost five years after the first Lego movie impressed critics and entranced its target audience of families with young kids, its sequel blasts on to the screen and will probably not disappoint fans of the original.",1
 Don't let those Social Justice Warrior scolds stop you from enjoying the film's modest pleasures.,1
" [A]fter an opening sequence as promising as the one here, it needs at least an attempted follow-through, not the jumble of confused ideas and time-wasting effects that take up the bulk of the film. ",0
 The realism clashes with the princess-fantasy story.,0
" Murray hasn't made a comedy this winningly dumb and smart and -- yes -- sweet in a long time. If, indeed, he ever has.",1
" In the summer of big, expensive superhero flicks, Moonrise Kingdom evokes awe, wonder and the magic of escapism in a much smaller and more precious way.",1
" Maybe I'm getting cantankerous in my old age, but a barrage of cool special FX does not make a movie, at least not in my book, and the ongoing glut of seamless, more-real digital renderings only exacerbates the problem.",0
" By the time we reached the climactic and fantastically over-the-top showdown, I realized that while the characters were indeed trying to corner the market on smoldering glances, faux-Shakespearean proclamations and in-your-face symbolism.",1
 More involving and more nerve-wracking than its fairly predictable plotline necessitates.,1
" Ponderous, emotionally chilly Oscar bait.",0
 It's official. Reese Witherspoon is the new Meg Ryan.,1
" Halloween II is trying to be something more than 'just' a slasher movie, and while I don't think it's ever in any danger of succeeding I respect the fact that the guy tried.",0
" You really do not want to make the mistake of seeing a minute more of this movie, which is so compelling up to this point. The rest of it, which runs for a very long and tedious 20 minutes, is a right and confused mess.",0
" Elizabeth Wood's fire-breathing debut is an adrenalized shot of ecstasy and entitlement, a fully committed cautionary tale that's able to follow through on its premise because t's unafraid of being utterly loathsome.",1
 It balances the exhilaration of independence -- one of the great joys of growing up -- with the sobering realization that being a grown-up means there's no one around to protect you.,1
" Naturally, Nolan's desire to unite high and low culture doesn't always pay off, yet even when he gets pretentious, I don't hate him for it. Better a filmmaker who fails while overreaching than one who has a hit with Transformers.",0
" No one saw a Bad Santa sequel coming. And no one will be coming to see Bad Santa 2, once they get a whiff of the pungent stench of stale jokes and grim misanthropy wafting off this ugly, uninspired comedy.",0
" The offbeat screenplay turns even the corny bits in unpredictable directions, and it's rare indeed to see such consistently superb ensemble acting.",1
" Rowan Atkinson's comic genius buoys the film somewhat and provides some laugh out loud moments, but the film suffers from the underuse of its secondary characters and spluttering narrative propulsion.",1
" This movie suffers from idiotic dialogue, ridiculous situations, and unbelievable characterizations throughout.",0
" Today's kids are learning from the Turtles that the world is a sinkhole of radioactive waste, that it's more reassuring to huddle together in sewers than take your chances competing at street level, and that individuality is dangerous. Cowabunga.",0
 Arteta's movie takes a grand leap ... and clears the chasm with room to spare.,1
 A step back from the three previous films because they have not managed Brian O'Conner's absence. [Full review in Spanish],0

 The final film has been labeled the 'epic conclusion' and I was elated to discover that it didn't disappoint.,1
" Francis has got an interesting eye and goal in mind here, it's just the material needed more refinement and stronger structural beats for it to reach its admirably lofty ambitions.",0
" The confluence of rebellion, personal responsibility and genre violence never quite gels, perhaps because the realities of a zombie movie ultimately dictate where these things are headed.",0
" Less than propulsive as a narrative, but provocative, instructive, consistently surprising and a kind of slow-motion thriller.",1
 Some things should be left in the past and forgotten. Case in point: Tarzan.,0
" Lilting doesn't have any momentum or any sense of ambiguity, once the setup has been established.",0
" Preston Sturges extended his range beyond the crazy farces that had made his reputation with this romantic 1941 comedy, and his hand proved just as sure.",1
" On to the characters, who were sad and despairing back in the day, but always empathetic and never victims. Here... well, I'm not that sure who they are.",0
 It comes across as a more lifeless version of last fall's Keanu Reeves vehicle John Wick.,0

" This is not only going to make the little ones jump, but it made a few big ones (like me) jump, too! It's scary",1
" Unflinching as it is unconventional, this gory composite of multiple genres also might be the first thinking man's slasher film. ",1
" Obvious, broad and burdened by leaden lines of dialogue that are dropped here and there like demented coconuts.",0
" I can honestly say Pirie's pint-sized Wolverine act - and Abrams's willingness to be beaten to a pulp in the service of a laugh - are oddly complementary, and shouldn't be missed.",1
 What makes Kalifornia intriguing is the manner in which these characters all relate to one another. Where the film suffers is in its obliviousness toward its own obviousness.,1
" Visually drab despite the locales and emotionally parched despite the source, this isn't so much the heights as the cinematic depths.",0
" Not a good movie, and probably better left unwatched. Which, for a DisneyToon sequel, is actually a pretty good place to land.",0
" When a movie this awful tosses the adjective ""bad"" into its title, we call it truth in advertising",0

 You don't even have to be familiar with the first movie made from the Hitman title (or even remember that there was one) to judge this reboot,0
" It's an effectively feel-bad story, deploying a torrent of wounded, retrograde masculinity to make uttering the word ""rape"" an even greater transgression than the event itself.",1
" The movie condenses the complicated Wiseau-Sestero relationship into a broad ""two friends take on Hollywood"" narrative, robbing the story of so many of its eccentricities.",0
" Sweet but relatively sappy, Everything, Everything will mostly speak to the young-adults in the crowd who will find the story and the material right up their alley. It's everyone else we're worried about.",0
" Perhaps most fascinating is that while the title suggests the film is centered on revenge, it's also a coming-of-age dark fairytale",1
" What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.",1

" It is highly inventive, but rather disappointing.",0
 An enduring meditation on living life. A great film.,1
" Watkins knows how to make a body jump out of its skin, even if he does use the face-reflected-in-the-mirror/window trick once too often. At the same time, the film is kind of, well, silly.",0

 Kudos to versatile director Johnnie To and writer-actress Chang for delivering a far from workman-like Office.,1

" But as for the rest of the adventure, this tape seems a parody of video games, a medium that has not been very successful on the big screen. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
" If a movie's success is measured by its ability to get under our skin and provoke a reaction, then this might be the film of the year. Designed to make us furious, this drama pushes us to the brink as we shout at the characters for being so naive. ",1
" A grotesque, lopsided edifice - take a few steps back and look up in sickened awe.",1
 The film is so conserned with the main characters past that one wonders why writer Steven Knight didn't chose to tell the story of his descent into darkness instead of what we see on screen. [Full review in Spanish],0

 Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch.,0

" Like two-year-old Joe in the film, von Trier is a toddler discovering his private parts, flashing willies, bums and vaginas at us - both literally and figuratively - in the hope that we'll either be outraged, bored or both.",0
" Singer deserves credit for attempting to put a human face on such tragic circumstances, but he appears to have gotten so close to his main subjects that he seems unwilling to make them, or their desperate situation, look too bad.",0
" Sporadically funny, casually sexist, blithely racist and about as visually sophisticated as a parking-garage surveillance video.",0
" Occasionally the film is so bad it's almost funny, if you think a scene in which a cat is used as a football is funny.",0
" 'The Town' hits not one false note, despite a plot that easily could have come across as contrived.",1
" Like the 2003 original, the comedy Bad Santa 2 is a foul-mouthed and mean-spirited Christmas tale -- but, unlike the original, it loses its nerve in the final reel with a stab at unearned redemption.",0
 Yet another anaemic horror retread starring a cast of good-looking TV totty.,0
" As a slapstick adventure, Barbershop is unfunny and unoriginal. But as a character-driven drama, Barbershop works well, with its quirky, sweet characters and authentic dialogue.",1
" 'Hitchcock' is the 'JFK' of movies about moviemaking, but at least Oliver Stone had the excuse of Jim Garrison's ""findings"" to hang his loony fiction on. ",0
 It's reductive and overly schematic in the way movies about the literary and intellectual life tend to be.,1
" Early on, Cooper's movie finds an episodic rhythm and follows it to dramatic cul-de-sacs. Just turn around and head somewhere else, from jai alai frontons in Miami to shipping weapons to the Irish Republican Army.",0
" With the laughs being fairly sporadic, Falcone's generally slack pacing is laid bare and the movie as a whole feels all the more meandering, try though McCarthy might to enliven the proceedings.",0
 Junfeng presents the grim world of the executioner to suitably unnerving effect.,1
" Several 'comic relief' scenes revolve around the boys making female characters uncomfortable. I know they're not supposed to be role models, but what is troubling is that the writers think this is funny.",0
" Above all, this beautifully photographed documentary is a poetic meditation on refined sensory perception.",1
" If devastation porn is your cup of tea, this is the picture for you. That's all it has to offer-just monster-on-monster, building-bashing action like you haven't seen since maybe last week. ",0

 Why are dying people so bloody selfish? What about poor Zach and his broken dreams?,0
" We are used to seeing Tautou play the sweetheart. Here, she's anything but. Constantly smoking, dour, unsmiling, critical, she plays a character difficult to warm to but fascinating to watch.",1
 The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn. The results are far more alienating than involving.,0
" For anyone expecting the comedy to rise beyond the moronic, The Waterboy is all wet!",0
 Yet another sequel no-one needed; too bad Donald Pleasance didn't stick around long enough to live it down.,0
" Given the relationship of the installation to the film and the film to the installation, it's impossible for one work not to overcloud one's view of the other.",0

" There's a rawness, urgency, and intensity to Southpaw that is utterly invigorating, but there's also a rich beat of sensitivity that effectively counters its blood-specked rhythms.",1
" Utterly, unquestionably gorgeous to look at, but at heart a fairly bog-standard futuristic action movie, GITS is all Shell with barely a Ghost of anything inside.",0
 They should have called Galactus Twistus instead because he appears as a left-over special effect from Twister . . .,0
 I loved the film for its intransigencies.,1

" Thomas remains a bland, uninspiring leader that was basically born the 'Great Saviour,' but he never seems like a big deal. ",0
" Ozon frames this story as a romance, but that is the filmmaker doing his own act of deception.",1
" The bold, visionary film jolts us with its sense of scope, scale and social outrage that sometimes suggests novels by Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo.",1
" ""Whatever Works"" is Boris Yellnikoff's personal motto. It works for him, for his rag-tag friends, and best of all, for the audience, too.",1
" With a talented young cast, headed by a strong yet vulnerable performance by the stardom-bound Hunt, takes both the horror and the music seriously, creating a perfect chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter genre mix.",1
" The movie treats a girl's burgeoning sexuality as neither epic nor problematic, or mutually exclusive of feelings of love, but rather simply, refreshingly, as one part of maturing.",1
 It certainly is fascinating.,1
" What we get is what would happen if Monet tried to pass a paint-by-numbers work off as a stroke of his brush. Yet, just like Monet, Mann has personal touches that make the film stand out.",1
" Dour and obvious, this is a disappointing footnote to the original.",0
" Predictable from the start, Forte's script marches dutifully through its Sid Field-appointed paces, never deviating from the gospel formula by which such films are supposed to become blockbusters.",0
" Just as clever, emotional and fun as the first film, while expanding on the story in a unique way with another driven performance from Jessica Rothe. ",1
" This Cabin may not be the Parthenon, but it's definitely a place to worship the gods of horror.",1
 What could have felt like a quirky throwaway sketch padded out into a feature is instead an oddly moving piece of genuine filmmaking.,1
" Garcia's reluctance to go overboard supernaturally, and his commitment to relative good taste -- save for one fart joke, not kidding -- take an already lean parable and render it stingy.",0
" The Gallows isn't without a certain amount of atmosphere, it simply feels borrowed wholesale. That would matter less with a better script, but the four main characters are paper-thin even by genre norms.",0

" What X-Men offers are outrageous makeup and costumes, gaudy overproduction and that bland, dopey dialogue.",0
" Enjoyable as camp rather than as a manual for living, or even good filmmaking.",1
" Williams can hit the notes; she's slight, thin-legged, a serious waif. We can worry about her easily enough. The problem is that nothing sticks out more than poised acting in a naturalistic film.",0

 So much of Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg's Mile 22 is masculine posturing and testosterone-fueled idiocy.,0
" There is little to laugh at here - and that is the problem. This is a loud, silly film that takes itself seriously.",0
" However you slice it, The Eagle is hokum, but modern-day Scots may get a kick out of the film's depiction of their ancestors as mud-caked hellions. Modern-day Romans will have to settle for less.",0

" The Hunting Party has good aim, but just misses.",0
 It's also fun to watch Watson try to be an L.A. bad girl. She has the acting chops to go way beyond being one of Harry Potter's best friends.,1
" ...one of the most gleefully unconventional, joyfully anarchic, and thoroughly original films of the 1980s.",1
" It's a singular life, marred by the fact that Dickinson didn't live to enjoy the admiration her poems now attract. And I can't think of another director with the sensibility to put it on screen.",1
" A fascinating, stately thriller.",1
 Formulaic writing is lifted to a higher level by a talented ensemble plus real stand out performances from Huttlestone and Rhys Meyers - even if their scenes together are contrived.,1

" Cold Mountain is the equivalent of comfort food: old-fashioned, earthy, satisfying.",1
" Adams' acting is masterful: she is strong, raw and vulnerable, a beating heart in the bloody mess of humanity's fear. It's a powerhouse performance in a stunning film that transcends genre to become art.",1
" Not funny at all, but, director Susanna Fogel has a legitimately great eye for action, so this could be something of a calling card for her directing a different kind of film. ",0
 It's just never as gripping as it needs to be.,0
" ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is the first comics-inspired film to truly bring the heart, look, and feel of its source material to the big screen.",1
" Fish Tank is grim, to be sure, but it leaves us with a feeling of hopefulness.",1
" ""Hotel Transylvania 3"" may lack the indelibility of the medium's best offerings for kids, but hopefully its clear theme of acceptance lingers long after the inoffensive odor of its fart jokes dissipates.",1

 Good action but nothing else - and the open ended ending is getting old.,0

" Might appeal to those under twelve, as the kid-friendly epic has video game watchability.",0

" The majority of the humor falls flat, the pacing holds no true momentum, and passing entertainment value turns to frustration before the first hour is up.",0
 Cars 2 demonstrates that not every hit movie merits a sequel.,0
" In his feature debut, Australian writer/director Ben Young takes a simple and deeply unpleasant torture-porn narrative -- a young woman is abducted by a monstrous suburban couple -- and treats it like high art. It very nearly works.",0
" Where the original had too many car chases and not enough plot or characterisation, this has too much plot, too many characters and not enough metal crunching, tyre squealing action.",0

" One Hour Photo is one of those films that springs from an interesting, original premise and then doesn't know what to do with itself once it's halfway complete.",0
 Allow yourself to be consumed by the eerie tone and convincing performances and there is every chance you will be consistently gripped for this impressive foray into old-school horror.,1

 Elevated by strong production values and an excellent cast. ,1
" ""Killing Them Softly"" pleases as an exercise in both surface style and tangy verbiage, but it's the rare genre entertainment one wishes would think a bit less. ",1
" The Chronicle Of Anna Magdalena Bach disregards most conventions of costume drama to ask some very human questions about history, what it takes to be an artist, and what movies can tell us about ourselves.",1
 Good-looking but not very effective.,0
 The humor of this rambling film runs dry to the point of unpalatable.,0
" At a certain point, like a dying star about to pop into eternal nothingness, the movie can't be seen as anything -- it just implodes.",0
 Director Hedges's signature trademark of broad comedy with family sentiment on display with reasonable success.,1
" The Artist is so wonderful that the audience applauds everything, including the dog.",1
 The movie comes across as little more than a Nicholas Sparks romance that drives on the wrong side of the road.,0
" The unexplored story opportunities of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director Anderson.",1
 The President is a boob in this lazy rip-off. Not funny except for one gem: the angry Arab gay cousin with a dream Weitz steals from him. ,0

" Witty and warm as cashmere, Green Book is a two-hander in which both stars soar with humor and heart.",1
" This is a heady mix, but it sounds funnier than it plays, because it needed a Billy Wilder level of cynicism, and Weitz doesn't have anything like that.",1
" When is a phone call from your dead friend more than just bizarre? When it's made on a hot dog. It's a hopeless mess. But, at least, for its first half, a very entertaining mess.",1

" Simply put, a hugely enjoyable mockumentary that will get a smile out of the most coldest of hearts.",1

 It works as a funny and slicker-than-expected parody of the genre.,1

 The art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema's oddest would-be auteurs.,0

 This foul-mouthed effort coasts on its leads' strong three-way chemistry and crack timing.,1
" A Romanian political allegory - in Romanian - might sound like tough sledding, but thanks to a searing performance by Luminita Gheorghiu, ""Child's Pose"" is anything but.",1
 The film also develops in a way that although over-the-top feels grounded in a recognisable reality.,1
" Why, given that Sexy Fighting Robot Lady, has a Barbie body, does she bother with underpants and clothes in some scenes but not in others? Do Donald Duck rules apply? ",0
" I was surprised by the film's shift from adventure story to romantic melodrama, and yet the turn feels natural. Everyday life more often resembles a melodrama than an adventure story.",1

 Go see The Front Runner to see an army of cinematic masters at the top of their game.,1
" Until it sputters to a nonsensical close, the film is a spooky entertainment.",0
" There's an impressive, lived-in authenticity about the movie, but it's bogged down by heavy-handed symbolism, rote storytelling and zero female characters of note (sorry Zoe Saldana). Well-made, but why?",0
" The film has the handmade quality and intimacy that Jonze so clearly was after, but it lingers too much in a kind of dragging, adult sadness that feels too overwrought for the film's inner child.",0
" Panders to its audience instead of challenging the sensitive juggling act that working mothers face every day. This picture is not insight, it's a display of insipid wish fulfillment. ",0

 Ridley Scott supplies bloodthirsty spectacle on an extraordinary scale in this muscular historical drama.,1
 An inflammatory documentary that artfully skewers its subjects. Sic 'em Kirby!,1
 At the center of the film is a conservative lesson that asks us to unquestioningly abide by society's capitalistic impulses.,0
 Intermittently amusing.,0
" It's understandable why the filmmakers wanted to avoid the worst of what we are capable... but it also makes the story become something far more common, and thus less than [Novelist Richard] Wright's vision.",1
" This movie is a well crafted dramatic thriller that will keep you guessing until the film's conclusion. Even with Melissa Leo's phony performance, it's one the year's most gripping films.",1
" The movie finds its rhythm as it goes, toggling between the sheer terror and adrenaline of embedding in the world's ugliest conflicts, and the murkier traumas of bringing that knowledge back home.",1
" Even if you knew nothing of Juno going in, it's easy to pick up on the fact that the movie's voice is unlike any you've heard in a while -- it's totally fresh, in every sense of the word.",1
" It's not that the satirical Pretty Bad Actress doesn't make valid points about the cycle of celebrity, but that it doesn't add much uniqueness to this conversation.",0

" While it's not animated with the breathless pizazz of a Pixar, 'Despereaux' is all the more affecting and dramatically successful for its contemplative pace and measured delivery of information. A lovely film.",1

 Mr. 3000 ends with a terrific joke involving Viagra that coldly reminds just what type of film this could've been had Charles Stone allowed Bernie Mac to run with it.,0
 This dull trifle forced me to co-opt the names Sleepy and Grumpy for the duration of its running time.,0

" This is a movie set in an on-screen world that feels familiar, the American inner city, in this case one of Miami's toughest neighborhoods. But it meticulously defies the conventions typically associated with movies about that milieu.",1

" Eastwood takes on the story in a straightforward, apparently conventional Hollywood fashion that camouflages his deeper intention -- the exploration, if not explosion, of masculine myth.",1
 The final third of this movie isn't a remake of the original film but of the bland sappiness of the original kiddie books.,0
" If you are interested, even slightly, in what distinguished Alan Turing, this is not the film for you. It has about as much to do with his contributions to automation as does a Judd Apatow movie.",0
" Logan Lucky is sensational, the fact it stole my heart away with seemingly so little effort whatsoever the greatest heist of them all.",1
" This is a delightful, curious film that indulges in both the personal and the political and provides a potted history of modern Iran through one woman's experience.",1
 A thinking person's film for those who can't think.,0
" Magnificent in its thoroughness and nuance, this dense, multifaceted study of Somali piracy really needs to settle down.",1
 Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.,0

" So, you're going along with your life as a rich Hollywood screenwriter, and BAM! You get amnesia. Ain't that the way it always goes?",0
" The After Party is a ""one crazy night"" movie. It's a buddy movie. It's a coming-of-age-movie. Unfortunately, it's not sure which one to focus on.",0
 The film captures very vividly indeed the urgency and turbulence of the period in which the AIDS epidemic took hold.,1
" Barry Jenkins' follow-up to Moonlight is slightly less radical, but makes up for it with a powerfully restrained anger, and much beauty.",1

" While the script by Matt Greenhalgh doesn't soar, the performances do.",1
 Everything gets bogged down in one spectacularly gory action sequence after another.,0
" Funny, aching, rueful -- often at the same time -- The Kids Are All Right makes most mainstream releases this year seem decadent by comparison.",1

" The actors excel, particularly Levya, whose turn will knock you sideways.",1
" [Hallie] Meyers-Shyer writes flatly and directs without purpose, an unreasonable facsimile of her parents' fluff formulas.",0

" An oppressive movie filled with a blaring seriousness, inconsistent production design, mundane conflict, heavy exposition and a huge amount of super-destructive action that leads to nothing.",0
 [Vega's performance] anchors A Fantastic Woman in a way that cuts through politics and prejudice.,1
" Even after appropriately lowering expectations, it's kind to call this one a cut below.",0

 The result is a film that does everything it's meant to without doing any of it all that well.,0
" It's always nice to see Tiffani-Amber Thiessen wearing almost nothing. But, sadly, the rest of it isn't worth the money it would take to get into even a bargain matinee.",0
" Tana doesn't make the viewing experience palatable, ruining a chance to make what's basically a filmed horror convention an absolute treat.",0
" Paranoid anomie was just the thing in a post-Watergate world back in the '70s, and movies then reflected it. That makes this delightfully, unapologetically old-fashioned.",1
" The Emoji Movie should not be supported because it celebrates lazy filmmaking, bad storytelling, and materialism. ",0
" I don't roll out the word ""gratuitous"" often, but the unremittingly brutal last act can't escape the charge: it's too, too much.",0
 None of this is remotely funny. It's actually kind of sad.,0
 Strangest thing is: It's not as irritating as you might think.,1
 The movie's inadequacies exemplify the chief problem it diagnoses -- our society's reluctance to allot sufficient time for crucial issues to be defined and argued in depth.,0
" an enterprise marked by an unlikable hero, patently unconvincing special effects and a muddled screenplay that chokes like LeBron James under the weight of giant gobs of raw exposition.",0
" Actors Josh Duvendeck, Kyle S. More, Matt Cook and Matt Shively get some OK slapstick energy going with this, but advocates for those with learning disabilities would not be wrong if they have complaints.",0
" The worst things about Basic Instinct, though, are the explicit ""love"" scenes. They're supposed to contribute to a heady equation in which sex, violence and psychology are fused; instead, they're gratuitous, exploitative, and entirely unerotic.",0

 A desperately hit-and-miss affair.,0
" The Mummy Returns learns from the past to produce a film that is bigger, better and more tightly wound than the '99 original.",1

" Flashing backwards and forwards through time, the film includes enough emotional firepower and startling revelations to keep you guessing at every turn.",1
 The plot is a formulaic ditty where the cop uses a beautiful woman as bait to trap the killer. It has very little to do with surrealism or desert photography.,0
 The problem with the new film is that Ice Cube is too cool for the plot's nonsense. The faulty house and McGinley's behavior never inspire him to blow his top.,0

" Even if you don't respond to binge-reading Situationist texts or making bad art in cigarette-strewn studios, there's a universal story here-a social network of friends and a cause that yields to end-of-summer realities.",1
" Conventional, respectable and slightly dull.... Who'd have thought that Stone's telling of Snowden's remarkable story would be so unremarkable?",0
 The film's monochromatic images are so beautiful they're almost as soul-nourishing as the transporting vocals and otherworldly reels the soundtrack envelopes us in.,1
" This is Meyer's worst offense -- her disturbingly Victorian attitudes about sex and love, which this particular movie falls modestly in lockstep with, even though it concludes years of cinematic foreplay.",0
" Although Darren Aronofsky's mother! can be an exceptionally frustrating film, one never doubts that behind it there is a vision of what it all means.",1

 Mildly enjoyable throughout...[the film] has a hard time competing with its own trailer.,1

 Joe Cornish's entertaining feature debut is an intriguing idea and has some nice moments but it also suffers from a problematic approach to its characters and is neither as funny or as scary as it should have been.,1
" While this film is a bit weaker, and a lot darker, than the first, it does have a strong story, interesting characters and great digital animation.",1
 Arsenal is not so much a movie as it is a concept of what certain people think a movie should have.,0

 Raw marks a debut in which director Julia Ducournau delivers a blood-stained calling card you won't soon forget.,1

" The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both.",1
" Gross and off-putting, a luridly ""gritty"" crime drama populated by sleazy characters (including the alleged good guys) and marked by a casual disregard for human life.",0
" Anyone with 138 minutes to spare can have a fuller, more satisfying entertainment experience in every way by hunting up the original.",0

 Another vaporous Sundance hit...,0

 The intensity is too much to bear in the best possible way. Legrand knows exactly where to position his characters and what's necessary to break them.,1
" If I Stay never explains whether Mia's is a special case or if everyone who hovers between life and death has that decision to make. And if it's the latter, does that mean your gramps and meemaw simply didn't love you enough to stick around?",0

" Maybe it all serves a purpose, but a movie about empty people doesn't necessarily have to feel empty itself.",0
" Though it falls short of the studio's best in many respects, Brave is ravishing to look at. Merida's carrot corona is alone worth the price of admission. ",1

 The Poochie of movies.,0
" To fail at understanding, in this case, is exactly the point.",1
" The story is constructed so we don't need to know what has come before. At the same time, the filmmakers don't want to alienate the long-termers, so they had to add something new to the canon of Trek lore.",1
" In its low-key lyricism with glimpses into the epiphanic, this is a beautifully controlled movie.",1
" Bates Jr. brings a satisfying level of disturbance to the effort, keeping the audience sufficiently unnerved even with unknown turns of plot, while sustaining its rather lucid take on a terrible relationship.",1

" Despite the best efforts of all concerned, what seemed explosive and provocative two decades ago now comes across as schematic and artificial.",0

" Even accounting for the difficulty, ""Bitter Harvest"" is a weak effort, with nothing to redeem it save for a certain base level of competence.",0
" Overall, the film is freaky and gruesome enough to keep horror fans thrilled, especially as the monsters get stronger, faster, badder and nuttier.",0
" The absolute best I can say about this movie is that I didn't hate it, I didn't mind watching it and I see no reason to ever watch it again.",0
 The action (all at nighttime) is messily and crudely filmed. The plot mechanics are often laughable.,0
" Comprising multiple, loosely interwoven plot threads united as much by the characters' lyrical speech patterns as their end-of-life longings, ""Ray Meets Helen"" has a wistful, whimsical sophistication that has all but disappeared from movies.",1
" A witless, slavish pastiche of the series of romantic dramas based on Stephenie Meyer's Twilight novels. It is a knowing film that knows nothing about comedy.",0
" Tedious, self-important and at times exhausting!",0
" There's a certain amount of pain in Where the Wild Things Are, but it's completely earned. The movie fills you with all sorts of feelings, and I suspect children will recognize those feelings as their own.",1
" In 1984's ""The Terminator,"" machines came back from the future to wipe out humanity; with ""Terminator Genisys,"" a whole franchise comes back from the past to water down summer moviegoing.",0
" Don't mess with the chicks. Osama bin Laden did, and look what happened to him.",1
" Allen refers to ''a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' That's a pretty high-toned way to limit his liability for the lackluster quality of this very slight entry in the canon...",0
 Not even a good effort from Matt Dillon -- who seems to play the hard-done-by cop/security guard for the umpteenth time here -- can provide this stodgy outing with the caffeine kick it is sorely in need of.,0
" A Most Violent Year is a morality tale, told with grace and insight. Everything about this picture fires on all cylinders. I was thoroughly absorbed from start to finish. ",1

 A conditional victory.,1
 Happy Feet is the kind of musical comedy that might have swept the world if MGM had been based in Antarctica instead of Culver City.,1

" Sorkin takes full advantage of the impeccable talents of his leading lady, and Chastain commands every scene she's in.",1
" The Meg can't decide if it wants to be silly or serious, and never really succeeds as either. Self-awareness is all well and good in a giant shark movie, but not when it undercuts the tension.",0
" Brahman Naman is like a crispy Samosa with nothing at the center. The Netflix release pays homage to American sex comedies from Porky's and Revenge of the Nerds to There's Something About Mary, but lacks the heart to go along with the excess of raunch.",0
 One of the slowest and most deliberately minimalist science fiction films ever made.,1
" English director Sam Mendes drains Anthony Swofford's scathing, hilariously profane memoir about his stint as a Marine Corps sniper during the first Gulf War of much of its righteous anger.",0

" Has a wit and style you won't find in his kick-ass work for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly or The Avengers.",1
" Less CGI and scripted preaching, more intuitvie tears, please.",0

" Under writer-director Sean Mullin, everything clicks.",1
 This one is a noble failure.,0
" Still, Day's scene involving a mountain of cocaine is hyperspeed-hilarious, Farrell's unhinged, irrational fuming is marvelously cretinous, and Aniston's fully committed sex-addict sexpot act is wickedly absurd.",1
" John Michael McDonagh is having a lot of fun deconstructing the cop procedural in The Guard, because almost nothing goes as planned and everything has a satirical bent. It is a very funny black comedy with a stylish palette.",1
" It sticks to many of the conventions of the form - printed titles, an effortless musical score, a loyal dog, and shameless melodrama - and has fun with them, yet also manages to be surprisingly heartfelt.",1
" The script is a clumsy patchwork of The Shining, Alien and anything else the writers could rent (not read, mind you) at Blockbuster.",0

" A tremendously exciting popcorn spectacle, and also a portrait of extraplanetary survival convincing enough that it had my tech-obsessed 11-year-old companion on his feet cheering on several occasions.",1
" You could have made a movie about the genuine tragedy of a man realizing he's become an abuser (you could have made a comedy about that!), and instead you totally made a movie about how a man's violence is a woman's fault.",0
" It's got plenty of mystery (starting with the one hinted at in the title), lots of action, several cities full of exotic-to-Americans scenery, a likable hero, a bit of romance and the faintest whiff of existential philosophy.",1
 You can't say this movie is going for subtlety.,0
" Directed by Francis Lawrence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire satisfies and yet again leaves me wanting more.",1
" There is action aplenty from start to finish and the fight choreography is splendid, especially considering that this is a 50 year old movie.",1
 The film creates both a fresh text from old conventions and fresh kills with innocuous objects.,1
" I liked the whole 'idea' of the movie, enjoyed most of its execution, till about the half-way point.",1
 This is the second best films of 2007 and by far the most moving.,1
" If you figure it out, let me know.",0
" A bizarre, moving and witty how-dunnit that makes you look twice at the work of Johannes Vermeer.",1
" A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. Pity, then, that its penchant for sentimentality makes it miss congeniality.",1
" You might argue that the script is perhaps too tidy and neat, but the rich sense of place and multidimensional characters are too seductive to resist.",1
" I can't believe that Freestyle actually got this movie to be released in the theaters. It's dull, boring, and at best, laughably bad.",0
" Before this urban revenge melodrama falls apart in a clatter of plot absurdities and pretensions, it has its loopy charms.",0
" There's plenty of money on the screen, but no energy or conviction; no sense that the movie believes any of this matters.",0
 A Pretentious Mess of a Bio-pic In the Worst Sense of the Phrase.,0
 Count Mickey Blue Eyes as Viterelli's second solid mob comedy of the year!,1
" Many will [...] praise [Toni] Collette's unflinching lack of vanity and honesty in this portrayal, but I found her performance predictable.",0
" After this promising start, the movie itself suddenly downturns and plummets to its own death.",0
" never does it get any more amusing than someone falling down, falling out of a window, or falling off of a bed",0
 Takes a good whack at exploring the difficulties in treating an at-risk ward of short-term foster-care teenagers.,1
" Though it's shot beautifully, Novitiate's pacing, focusing on the sisters' daily routines, is slow.",0
" As a movie, Super is unfocused and bafflingly inconsistent. It is also the most genuinely surprising new release I've seen in a long time.",1
" Like looking at a black light poster on uppers: It's visually lovely, and you're having a good time, but there's also a small nagging sense that somebody might have brought the wrong drugs to the party.",1
" The movie is unfailingly likable and finally impressive. Goldin doesn't settle for easy answers, and he makes you think that no one should.",1
" By the time it reaches a climactic good-against-evil showdown, the film ditches its character development in favor of a flashy fanboy fantasyland.",0
 Deceptively simple and emotionally elegant,1
" Diane Lane borrows Sandra Bullock's blond wigs and can-do attitude for Secretariat, a horse movie that feels like a lazy workout rather than a high-stakes race. Secretariat is a strenuously feel-good flick that could be subtitled The Blinders Side.",0
" The Wind Rises, in its own mysterious, inimitable ways, is a fitting farewell for a director committed to the power of creativity.",1
" It's not that every film has to achieve some grand epiphany, but Touch Me Not is not nearly as satisfying as the primal act it's obsessed with.",0
" Looking and feeling like a true independent film, it was a shame that it felt so uneven and limited in thrills along the way.",0
" Mortensen warms the film with his presence, creating a vivid portrait of a bereft man clinging to the one thing he has left.",1
" In both its TV and movie incarnations, the empty materialism and sincere longing for love always manage to cancel each other out, leaving behind nothing but what this started out as -- a sitcom.",0
" Kravitz (Rough Night, Mad Max: Fury Road) is capable of better than this.",0
 Joan Cusack consistently steals the movie's heat and light!,1
" [Double Lover] has been billed as an 'erotic thriller' but as it is, in fact, a rape-culture fantasy dressed up as one, I found it about as erotic as descaling the kettle, say. Also, it felt 90 years long.",0
" Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene, 'Swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling.",0
 A better- than-average comedy that is raunchy and tasteless but ultimately funny from beginning to end.,1
 A bittersweet study in friendship and mortality that lets the sweet overwhelm the bitter,1
" When stuff that serves us turns deadly, we're in a world of hallucinatory hurt. FD5 occasionally generates that kind of frisson, but it never goes bone-deep. ",0
 You know something's amiss in 'Blades of Glory' when ringside commentators Scott Hamilton and Jim Lampley have the best lines.,0
 An underappreciated classic of the western genre; one that functions as a proto-revisionist piece repositioning one of the stories of the Old West to a Mexican perspective,1
 A great actor's movie.,1
" Edgerton's talent as an actor has been evident for a while, but The Gift announces him as a genuine triple threat. ",1
" Fascinating viewing not only for fully paid-up NYT subscribers but anyone with a fleeting interest in the past, present or future of the newspaper industry.",1
" This understated Irish charmer deserves to reach a wider audience, if only to remind people that animation is a diverse medium that can be exploited in numerous ways to tell all sorts of stories.",1
 Caution! Guy Ritchie has entered his Ingmar Bergman phase.,0
" The film is literate without being pretentious, bawdy without being gross and grounded in historical fact without being constricted by it.",1
" It's not on a par with Fargo or O Brother, but it's a solidly funny movie, a hybrid, weird-bird film like only the Coens can make.",1
 goes completely bonkers by taking the powers of Dracula to a ridiculous level,1
" Manchevski leaves us with too many unanswered questions, most of them involving the very time and space that these characters seem to inhabit all at the very same time.",0
" Much like ""Zodiac,"" ""Police, Adjective"" is a procedural piece that leads to nowhere.",0
" McConaughey unleashes that thousand-yard stare, and we wait for someone to say, ""I am Spartacus."" A misguided misfire.",0
" I found myself admiring ""The Bronze"" ... But admiring isn't quite the same as liking. This film is a comedy wrapped in barbed wire; approach with caution.",0
" Government officials take a calendar year to agree on the proper temperature of a Hot Pocket, I'm not sure they could legalize murder in just under a decade.",0
" I may be wrong, but my feeling is that I won't be able to say I have properly seen this film until I can see it on the big screen.",1
" Jun Ichikawa's slight, lovely little drama understands the pleasure of seeing, using many quiet, patient takes to absorb its delicate visuals.",1
" A modestly budgeted, respectfully executed post-WWII drama, the film is also entirely edgeless, and aside from a couple of swear words is ready to be shown in classrooms and on the History Channel in endless repeats.",1
" Shane Black, the buddy action auteur, is back in his wheelhouse-and he's delivered another inspired onscreen pairing in the blundering one-two punch of Gosling and Crowe.",1
 Destined to be a favorite...on cable TV.,0
" While Adam McKay's films have always had a political subtext, Vice may just be the writer-director's strongest outing by far.",1
" ...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.",1
" Blame the paintings! Its darkly satirical, ironic and over the top, and leaves a bitter taste. ",0

 I can't quite recommend the film.,0
" If movies be the food of love, play on.",1
" Was Liam Neeson looking for a script with lousier dialogue than ""The Phantom Menace""?",0
 A carefully calculated romantic drama that spins out the usual manifestos about the music industry devouring pretty young singers yearning for acceptance.,1
 The strength of Katniss Everdeen as a character is what makes The Hunger Games: Catching Fire so compelling. ,1
" Captain Marvel isn't a pain to sit through...but such a venerable character long overdue on the big screen, the talents involved in putting her there and Marvel's rabidly faithful international audience deserved much better.",0
 A lot of fun with excellent direction...,1
 Kinda made me homesick for Showgirls.,0
 The limited pop culture references and focus on its talented supporting players give Why Him? a charm that doesn't bury its insight.,1
 It's Splendor in the Grass meets The Blair Witch Project. You can take that any way you'd like to,1
" The film never comes up with a mission statement or a message that might tie together its wandering scenes, or explain its vague melancholy. In the end, it feels like a life-support system for a single perfect scene .",0
 Murphy exhibits a deft touch for a first-timer and can feel satisfied that his film honours the tradition of such spooky Brit works as The Haunting and The Innocents.,1
 A fresh and very funny look at the romantic comedy through the Korean-American lens.,1
 Boll is in fact fascinating - largely because his movies assume their audiences exist in an alternate dimension of human experience.,0
" T2: Trainspotting is unsurprisingly disappointing, even though a strong third act proves that it isn't a total waste of time. ",0
" If you really are going to push the stories of nearly 220,000 people into the background, you need a much better one than this to put into the spotlight.",0
 Walker's debut mines rapid-fire laughs and bountiful heart from a story of romantic misadventure set in train by a young man desperate to live up to his father's expectations.,1
 What could have been a funny and devastating portrait of a youth on the brink of adulthood instead devolves into not always convincing melodrama.,0
" This nails the '80s high-school experience, then blows it up for good measure. More fun than a game of strip croquet. Now that's deep.",1
" While it has some amusing moments, the picture never really takes off.",0
 It's a testament to the Safdies' incredible control as storytellers that neither the genre exercise nor the social commentary detracts from the emotional heft of this film.,1
 A hearty mainstream comedy with a sharp satirical edge balanced with just enough sentimentality to send audiences home happy.,1
" Its constituent parts are great, but just don't come together to make a coherent and satisfying movie.",0
" Five screenwriters, three stars, maybe two good jokes.",0
" A grim and unsavory tale of female empowerment with the kind of her-head-is-bloodied-but-unbowed ending you feel compelled to applaud, but can't bring yourself to do it.",0
 The premise sounds promising to be sure. But the execution (no pun intended) is excruciating. My issues with this film were so numerous that it's difficult to know where to begin.,0
" A try-anything, fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly.",0
" Dench deserves better, and unfortunately it will probably be a long time before she gets another starring role in a movie custom-made for an actress her age.",0
" because all of the thinking is already done for the audience, there's very little reason to care, and the end result feels like an elegant reenactment - at best.",0
" All things considered, Hidden Figures wraps some fairly radical themes - three African-American women entrusted with important NASA jobs at a time (1961-1962) when Jim Crow was still the law of the land - in a largely unradical package.",1
" Easily the year's best: taut, credible, exciting drama of police corruption and more.",1
 Macdonald's delicate acting makes it easy to identify with the thoughts and emotions flickering through Agnes' eyes.,1
" Despite its best efforts to be thought-provoking, the film is dramatically inert, slow and its revelations aren't all that politically illuminating, relying on coincidence and worn tropes to obfuscate its lack of ingenuity.",0
" The film's own dilemma might be best expressed by Ender, who challenges Graff, ""What are you going to do? Waste millions on a loser?"" It's a dilemma Ender's Game can't resolve.",0
 A coming of age dramedy that loses its way in the mean streets of modern Africa.,1
" The Austin, Texas-centric, green-screen addled cult of Robert Rodriguez has finally collapsed in on itself. All that's left to wonder is if anyone will bother to tell him.",0
" A psychologically horrifying, fascinating and emotionally devastating experience that should be studied, analyzed and discussed scene-for-scene by film buffs for its brilliant, stylish production values, allegories and allusions.",1
" More daring, more unexpected, and more thoroughly alive than anything this stuffy genre has seen since Gosford Park",1
" A grab bag of environmentally related talking points that never quite congeals into an argument, let alone a prescription.",0
 Solid holocaust drama that confuses the importance of the subject with the importance of itself.,1
" A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one.",1
" With nuance and an introspective eye, Almereyda creates a beautifully bleak, hypnagogic world in Marjorie Prime that allows its pensive themes to flourish.",1
" A bibbidy- bobbidy- bomb... more pumpkin than gilded coach, more smelly sneaker than glass slipper.",0
" Statham is one of the most appealing of action stars, but the film is a little light on action, and his narrow range is unfairly tested by the movie's narrative wallows.",0
" Disappointing. No, I'm being too generous: it's a complete disaster. [Full review in Portuguese.]",0
 It's a powerful film but also a truly enjoyable one.,1
" Before We Vanish is very funny, very bloody, and doesn't have a happy ending.",1
 Too much of the joy imparted by Muppets Most Wanted has too little to do with the Muppets themselves.,0
" beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary",0
" Stilted, claustrophobic and more stylish than substantial.",0
" A movie about victory, loss, paranoia, and tolerance. It also includes one of the best performances ever by Maguire. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Kyle Killen's script is generally uninspired and fairly predictable ...,0
 Moselle believes in the power of girls. The friendships through which Camille learns how to be loved become the anguish that breaks her heart and the forgiveness that humbly heals her.,1
" i usually hate these movies, but i kinda liked this one",1
 The result is just good enough to pass as an action flick you watch with the forgiving gaze that comes from too many beers and too little sleep.,0
" ""Keanu"" is a pure pop confection that delights even as it proves to be wildly uneven.",1
 This is a film that's simultaneously trying too hard and aiming too low.,0
 You try binge drinking when you're followed around by two burly Secret Service agents.,0
" Darker, colder and more violent, Day of the Soldado turns out to be a surprisingly solid, in-your-face sequel to the original. Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are once again great. [Full review in Spanish] ",1
" That there's a big difference between Nazi jokes and Holocaust jokes is one of the insights gleaned from Ferne Pearlstein's documentary concerning taboos in comedy, especially those concerning that generally forbidden topic.",1
" Miller shoots it in the inky graphic style of Sin City, but he clearly hasn't a clue how to stage a scene, or shoot it, and he singly fails to animate his actors.",0
 The only comedy-horror that ever worked was An American Werewolf in London - and it worked because it was about character.,0
" Mouth watering scandal, a juicy love triangle and high powered men behaving badly make this a solid drama about character and society in 18th century England",1
" [A] soul-bearing, intimate and genuinely uplifting...once-in-a-lifetime coming-of-age film. Epic is an understatement.",1
" Where the movie should hurt with an establishment built on dehumanization, it's stagy and inert.",0
 When's the last time you saw a sports movie in which there wasn't a voiceover from some chatty announcer explaining every single play that's happening on the field?,1
" The singing, dancing, live-your-dreams plot of High School Musical 3 may be even more retro than the '80s dance moves Ortega rips off, but then again, it's not retro if you weren't around for it the first time.",1
 Singularly fails to dramatise the genocide at the story's core with the cinematic force it deserves.,0
" The feature debut from award-winning short film director Elisabeth Subrin is a rewarding, if occasionally solipsistic, study of a complex, mature woman at a crossroads in her life.",1
" Despite a formidable and kaleidoscopic performance, there is a sense that the themes of human frailty and the will to heal that inform the film's narrative are beyond Aniston's abilities as a serious dramatic actress. ",0
 I'll just say this: The Big Lebowksi is an excellent movie - and damn funny.,1
" For all the evident despair, Hartley can't repress his love of cinema; the comic dialogue sings and many of the images have a fragile beauty.",1
" If you like your fantasy dark, your characters broad, and your stories familiar, this lushly imagined riff on the classic fairy tale should scratch an itch you may not have even known you had.",1
" What language the film does make us of, where it differs from Flaubert, is careless, littered with strange anachronisms and mistakes of usage and tone.",0
" The Children Act could do with a healthy dose of vulgarity, including cakes and ale.",0
" It's as if the filmmakers wanted to deliver a bitingly sardonic satire of violence in society, but the studio was forcing them to make a mainstream superhero movie.",0
 Borgman remains an elegantly teasing puzzle even as you begin to suspect there could be slightly less here than meets the eye.,1
" Eye-popping visuals, an ambitious narrative, and a heart-racing soundtrack; one of Nolan's best",1
" Two elements unify the overly episodic, fragmented, dramatically uneven tale: the predominantly dark mood and the motif of loss of innocence, which defines most of the subplots.",1
" Like the longhair with the foghorn falsetto it's titled after, this unfussy rock-doc profile is shaggy, sophisticated, and more than a little sad.",1
" Unusual, bittersweet - and vital.",1
" Like a video game, Rich Moore's 3-D film is colorful, noisy, and pixel-deep.",1
 This strange update on Joseph Conrad is in essence an epic of virtue-signaling.,0

 How on Earth is this from the same guy who gave us L.I.E. and 12 and Holding?,0
" Even with his observational style, Zhangke's film compels",1
" There's just no point in even bothering. In the vast conspiracy of stupidity that has overtaken pop culture, the disparagement of this movie by a film critic becomes an endorsement of a sad, twisted sort.",0
 Thierry Arbogast's cinematography is extraordinary.,1
" When 3D dust-motes and train-engine sparks are the most tempting things to look at, something has failed.",0
" It's a simple set-up fraught with promise, but each funny bit points to bigger blown opportunities.",0
 Somehow it all still works. Obvious Child is like one of those kid's paintings where the riot of irreconcilable elements is unified by the charm and madness of a skilled naivety.,1
 Has a larger frame of reference than Paine's battery-car docs but never hammers it into shape.,0
" The characters are overburdened by backstories that constrict rather than inform their behavior, with Heard especially weighed down by Jude's flailing indecision.",0
 ...comes off as a half-assed adaptation that feels as though it lost whole subplots during the editing process.,0
 Overall this genesis needed a little more incubation in the lab of its creator before going online.,0
" Maybe the giant leaps of faith that the original script calls for were easier to swallow 10 years ago, or perhaps it's just that Lee's version seems to mannered to be convincing.",0
" What Hell has in spades, though, is a manic energy that's becoming the calling card of Sono's filmography.",1
" All the world's a financial transaction just waiting to be negotiated in The Girlfriend Experience, a handsome, frosty, rather one-note time capsule from October 2008.",0
" With an estimated budget of $70-100 million, the only way this dog will make a profit is to reap as much as possible out of the opening weekend, before people can spread the word, and get out of town fast.",0
" Like your smartphone, it's a testament to the theory of interchangeable parts, a perfectly engineered product that, if you're charitable, you might also think of in terms of art.",1
" Though style ultimately outweighs substance, the film is formidably entertaining.",1
 Shyamalan only half-heartedly attempts to build a cinematic universe. Partly making it a twist and partly building a world makes for a wholly unsatisfying experience.,0
" Filled with likeable characters, smart dialogue and cool indie music, it's good natured, hilarious and an outstanding romantic comedy that makes you wish you could be there.",1
" Hugely enjoyable, feel-good social comedy that shines a much needed spotlight on an unsung true story, with a strong script, impeccable production design and terrific performances from a superb ensemble cast.",1
" In every move, Depp makes you believe this was a passion project for the actor, one he dedicates to Thompson.",1
" For a movie that's supposed to be about reconnecting with God and ourselves, and cherishing the Earth we live on, Evan Almighty is a surprisingly dispassionate picture.",0
" This brutally basic, frighteningly exciting thriller from Indonesia will jolt you out of the jaded zone.",1
 Can a bio-mathematician and a CIA operative meet-cute? They can in Wim Wenders' newest film.,1
" The framing device of Black Mass is a series of interviews with witnesses to the crimes of James ""Whitey"" Bulger and FBI agent John Connolly. It makes the actual scenes of the movie feel like the actors are re-enacting depositions. ",0
" What is very impressive about Raw is that absolutely everything about it is disquieting, not just the obvious moments of revulsion: there is no let up in the ambient background buzz of fear.",1
" An unappealing blend of the twee and the catty, its view of the Milnes is so crabby that it throws the big tear-jerking finale out of whack. It might as well have been written by Eeyore.",0
 Overstates the Establishment-vs.-youth culture impact of Britain's real-life offshore radio stations...,0
" A Hijacking is the story of two men and their fate, but in its unassuming, specific way, it's also about global capitalism and its fallout.",1
" While it wouldn't be fair to advise potential viewers to just say no to Sicario: Day of the Soldado, it would be acceptable to recommend that they approach it with lofty expectations held in check.",1
" This film with bloody sequences like 'Carrie', contributes to the solid, attractive and fun wave of new horror inspired by sex. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Fans will undoubtedly thrive on every second. For the rest of us, Monster is precisely that: a creature powerful but ungainly.",1
 Just another Rom-Com about the life of a group of single people in one of the biggest cities in the world. [Full review in Spanish],0
 Inspired pairing of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as an outrageous mother and her more practical daughter.,1
" Sadly, rather than melding the best of two worlds, the film only takes the worst of their soap operas.",0
" To its many producers, teaming Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt for the first time was obviously of far greater importance than finding a good story and a strong director.",0
" Half of the movie seems fresh and hair-raising. The rest is just disappointing and predictable. At least it provides the underrated Steve Zahn, a likable and inventive actor with natural talent, with a starring role. He makes every minute count.",1
 A twisted spin on the classic Snow White fairytale that strives for a humorous contemporary edge but mostly misses.,0
" Though a bit nostalgic and sentimental, docu offers invaluable information (and gossip too) about the evolution of ballet as an art form through firsthand testimonies with many of the survivors.",1
" It is shot well, the performances are engaging and strong, I was in it from beginning to end. I felt things for the characters, laughed, could not bring myself to cry because I physically cannot cry white tears, but it was emotionally provoking.",1
" There's a lot of predictable animal humor, but there are also several harrowing moments of nail-biting suspense.",1
" Although Imagine Me & You (never much liked that song) tries to tap into a popular theme, we never believe that Rachel and Luce are the slightest bit interested in one another.",0
" It's hard to imagine a movie less deserving of a high profile follow-up than ""Horrible Bosses,"" but, whether or not anyone really asked for it, ""Horrible Bosses 2"" is here. ",0
 Death House unfortunately doesn't deliver. Its many references and horror icons don't contribute much to a story that is far too caught up in itself to be any fun. Its graphic and lewd nature don't much help either.,0
" Suffragette makes a case for the historic importance of these renegade women, who launched the first wave of feminism, but you may wish the stirring narrative wasn't so streamlined.",1
 The kind of quirky labour of love I feel guilty for bashing.,0
" Costume and period sets are stunning as is the skilled cinematography, particularly during the elaborate scene and costume transitions early on. Unfortunately, the characters are less than fully developed...",1
" Those looking for a faithful adaptation may find that O is caught, awkwardly, between the twin themes of racism and corrosive jealousy.",0
" 'The Woman in Black' is old-fashioned, ornate, imposing, occasionally creaky - and possessed of more than a few enjoyably nasty surprises.",1
" The story takes its time, and that seriousness with which the director takes the words of his subject demonstrate the respect and admiration he feels for the topic. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" The movie version of Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"" is way too kind, and the drama suffers greatly for it.",0
" In the space of 90 minutes, it captures some of the worst acting ever committed to film... ",0
" All things considered, if I could get my hands on this remote, I'd rewind back to the first time I watched Happy Gilmore, just to remember what funny really is.",0
 The slender story line of good vs. evil is an excuse for many terrific fight scenes.,1
" Rarely, has 'true crime' ever been as emotionally devastating as it is in The Witness.",1
" This movie is constantly in motion, spinning from one level of the story to another.",1
" Louis-Dreyfus gives Enough Said exquisite vulnerability and crack comic timing, helping the helmer lift a slightly tiresome plot off the ground, finding behavioral realism in the midst of sitcom tension.",1
" Fun, sexy dance flick will appeal to teens.",1
" Nightingale rages on at times with no real direction. At others, it hits us over the head with pretentious symbolism. Oyelowo's inspired performance keeps it afloat.",1
" There were dialogue-free sequences that nearly moved me to tears. There is imagery so powerful that, like nature and the planet itself, is so indescribably gorgeous that it's hard to imagine it was created without divine intervention. ",1
" Ultimately, Suburbicon might have been better split into two movies, with each one given the space it needed to breathe. And isn't that what the suburbs promised?",0
" It's a bunny movie ... sorry, a buddy movie ... in family-fun land, where the rookie cop (a bunny) has to team up with a small-time crim (a fox) to track down bigger crooks. Anthropomorphic as it is, there is plenty of innocent fun",1
" If you're looking for an antidote to La La Land's sunny view of Hollywood, this works very well.",1
" This is ultimately just so heavy-footed and stodgy, with each performance punched out on a single, earnest, unvarying note.",0
" Zellweger gives a good performance as a fading Southern belle and determined mother in this rambling tale of the early years of suntanned actor George Hamilton, which combine elements of a road movie with a fictionalized bio.",1
" What could've been a clever or innovative spy caper instead feels about as exciting as a subdivision barbecue: not a bad time, per se, but wouldn't you rather be hanging out with James Bond?",0
" An awful movie of its type, a limp comedy that shamelessly resorts to endless shots of dogs, babies and older kids staring at the camera to pluck at viewers' heartstrings.",0
" A small-scale family drama that walks the walk, but doesn't seem to know where it's going half the time.",0
" A lot of what we see and hear is stomach turning. Yet ""Alien Boy"" attempts to be fair. The judgments come from without, rather than within.",1
" I don't want to be a wet blanket, boys, but here's the skinny: Unless it's raw Clooney-ness you seek (and that cup of Vitalis runneth over), or unless you think Zellweger's gams are the cat's meow, then scram before you upchuck.",0
" Although Shakespeare in Love benefits from a delightful screenplay by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard -- and a flattering one, for viewers who can congratulate themselves on recognizing this or that tatter of the Bard -- the film's virtues peter out.",0
" The movie's chief purpose seems to be reminding audiences of what they enjoyed in the previous movies, but the best way to enjoy those is to just go watch them again.",0
 Rob Tregenza's film is rooted in the communion as well as the sensorial challenges of savoring art.,1
 No war movie I have ever seen so vividly shows battle from differing perspectives.,1
" Political discussions take a back seat, way way back, to a combination of clownish villains in Halloween-style costumes and seen-it-done-that shooting gallery action.",0
" Noisy, repetitive and obnoxious, The Adventures of Tintin's sensory overload is somehow blindingly dull. The barrage of onscreen overstimulation will keep kids glued to their seats, but won't make them care about or cherish the characters.",0
" [S]upercool, superfun... [A] real geek's brew... of premises and possibilities. All of which somehow work together, don't feel underdone, and leave us feeling like, for all its absurdity, everything we see is happening in a real space to real people.",1
" Historically, throwing money at a comedy has never made it funnier, because there's nothing more cost-effective than a joke, and nothing more ruinous than a spectacle trampling all over it.",0
" Graves and Kendrick give their all to an intriguing, resourceful but underwhelming production.",0
" Roman Polanski proves his dexterity once again with this dark, mystifying, and anything but simple two-character, single-location film.",1
 There will be blood.,1
" A double travesty -- a triple one, actually, if you consider the quality of the singing and dancing.",0
" This is a limp, dull, predictable film, full of semi-creepy imagery and not a whit of brains or genuine thrills.",0
" Meyers' movies would be far less offensive if they were simply shiny, shallow entertainments. But they always read like pronouncements, monitor readings of how 'real' women think and feel.",0
" Hitman: Agent 47 has enjoyable action, paper-thin characters, and an incomprehensible plot. Well, one out of three ain't bad.",0
 Halloween: H20 is as stylish and scary as it is ultra-violent. It brings back a stunning Jamie Lee Curtis in the role that made her a star and it's a work of superior craftsmanship in all aspects.,1
" Hate is a strong word, but nowhere near fierce enough to describe the ear-steaming loathing Catwoman deserves.",0
" We've had a few great comedies along the way, but I Feel Pretty shows us that the march of progress in equal comedic representation also means we get the equivalent of an Adam Sandler movie sometimes.",0
 It's a boldly unconventional film from Barry Levinson ... But ultimately he takes its cloudy vagueness too far. The Humbling could also be called The Bewildering.,1
" Yes, you can enjoy bits and pieces along the way, more than a few, even. At the end of this journey, though, you feel more exhaustion and relief than catharsis or satisfaction.",0
" When a movie's premise is that its subject single-handedly moulded recent history, you want more depth and grandeur than this one provides.",0
" Spinoza once opined that you couldn't use words to describe God, because by choosing any one or several, you would be eliminating the infinite nature of the deity. That essential inadequacy of words drives much of Nolan's stunning film.",1
" Rigorous, impeccable and meaningful, [Manuel] Abramovich's latest film far surpasses his debut. [Full Review in Spanish] ",1
 An entertaining genre piece boasting a terrifically sinewy lead performance from Wanda De Jesus.,0
" The film's 85 minutes drag by painfully slowly, because there's no respite from Chapman's tedious, self-pitying reveries.",0
" It might be a flashy piece of entertainment, but it's not a stupid one.",1
" Playing out like a mediocre episode of Tales From The Crypt, it's slow, largely uneventful and not particularly exciting when something does happen... The Black Cat is a much more solid film, with a considerably better screenplay and some excellent acting",1
 Some may find scenes excessive and take offense at the suggestion that there were good Nazis like Ludwig. But one thing that can be said for Black Book: It's never boring.,1
" A blissfully sweet coming-of-age movie in which everyone, young and less young, comes of age.",1
" Purists might disagree, but you could argue that this reimagining of the 1960s comeback of jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker is closer in spirit to the riffing, improvisational nature of his music than a straight biopic could ever be.",1
" This is both a fitting tribute to a brave man and his committed team, and a thoughtful insight into comedy's duty to speak truth to power.",1
 I can't say Everyone's Hero strikes out -- it might distract little kids for a while -- but the directors needn't bother practicing their home run trots.,0
" In taking such a pillar of the form as the concert film and reworking it in electrifying fashion, you feel documentary has too, unsure when leaving the theater whether the music or the filmmaking has provided the buzz that refuses to wear off.",1
 ...by the end I couldn't help feeling the film had missed the mark.,0
" Tedious, asinine, jejune and so painfully unfunny that it will make your eyes and ears bleed. ",0
" A supremely entertaining, richly cinematic treat, which manages to work in some fun (and often very humorous) genre subversions and engaging character nuance amongst the frenetic gunplay.",1
" If this dull, cramped and literal film is any indication, Keillor's sturdy and expansive sense of imagination defies physical manifestation.",0
" Indisputably an impressive piece of documentary filmmaking. Whether that makes it a great document about what actually happened at Abu Ghraib is a separate question, and one that goes to the heart of Morris' project as a filmmaker.",1
 The sort of picture that is so engrossing that you'll want to come back and see it again soon.,1
 I don't know how a director whose central theme is the loss of humanity can be so uninterested in the minutiae of human speech and behavior.,0
" The movie is unfocused and moves in fits and starts, but like Lee's other work, it's extremely good-natured, and its celebration of family and friendship will connect with its target audience.",1
 A no-frills version of a perennial dark story: how love of a sort can take root in a festering place.,1
" A splendid reminder of just how assured, intelligent and involving Soderbergh's movies can be.",1
" What strikes me as entirely bogus is the notion, expressed in the movie's taglines, that this narrative can be interpreted as hopeful or positive.",0
" Despite a good moral, it has too much adult-oriented dialogue and situations for children and it's too stupid for adults.",0
 Don't let the trailers and adverts fool you. The Dressmaker is a viciously dark comedy that will catch many by surprise. ,1
" Despite the overall impressive filmmaking though, there are a few subplots that aren't handled quite as smoothly as the main arc.",1
" A compelling film on the phenomenon, Hobbyhorse Revolution celebrates its subject matter with enthusiasm, resulting in a doc which is both deeply moving and endlessly amusing.",1
" The world of the movie is the stuff of childhood fancy, but it never engages us in that transcendent way that brings even the most hardened adults into its imagination.",0
 This is the type of comedy Steve Martin would have made in his heydey. Strongly recommended. ,1
 Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter steal the show in this fun escapist drama.,1
" Without giving too much of the story away, if the film truly is holding a mirror up to life, we, as a species, might like to reconsider some of our recent actions.",1
 A painfully unfunny mess.,0
" Stick It uses the story of a gymnast's comeback attempt as a backdrop for overwrought visual effects, music videos, sitcom dialogue and general pandering.",0
 The movie slowly begins to descend into a vacuous state because the contrived script really has no place to go.,0

" This send-up of buddy-cop movies is a thoroughly entertaining blend of wry British humor and climactic, over-the-top action-film heroics.",1

" The film should come alive, but it just lies there, handsomely shot but dramatically inert. ",0
" As portrayed by Blunt, she's smart and confident, but also somewhat naive; it's an impressive performance in a surely daunting role.",1
" Unfortunately, his G-rated Bresson-as-poptimist approach is surprisingly dull, and the two Jeannes aren't exactly the best singers. ",0
 Another colourful animated adventure undemanding enough to please younger children.,1

 A quite absorbing but never riveting or revelatory overview of Armstrong's career and testy personality.,1
 The world of Amelie has no politics. It has no issues. It only has an exaggerated sense of quirkiness and a pea-green tint that suggests an overblown sense of nostalgia for childhood.,0
" Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable.",1
" Aside from the beautiful visuals that set an impressive pre-historic look, the film dragged.",0
" If you enjoy hide-and-seek horror films, this one isn't bad. Viewers who prefer more sophisticated plots may not agree with me.",0
 A coy and hollow parody.,0
 The biggest waste is Cage: a brief spot of shit-losing would've gone a long way to elevating this forgettable thriller. ,0
" Seems intent on being as generic and lowbrow as possible, with broad slapstick emphasized over witty dialogue or interesting characters.",0
" To be fair, I think Allen is best when his mood is sour like this, but Wonder Wheel still feels like too much of a retread to get a pass. ",0
" For all its beautifully established mood, this film remained, at least for me, curiously unsatisfying-a kind of exquisitely tasteful after-school special.",0
" These movies were written to be franchised, and as such, they don't disappoint.",1
" An incredibly maudlin, preachy, annoyingly mercantile public service announcement aimed squarely at eight-year-olds.",0
" As a study of human nature under pressure, focusing on the crimes we commit as well as the bonds of solidarity we forge, it's unremittingly dour.",0
" Even though the film won't fully commit to its more experimental flourishes, Hawke makes it feel truthful in a way that conventional music biopics rarely manage.",1
" It tells a full story with three acts, it introduces characters we get to know and care about, and it has something it passionately wants to say.",1
" For those who like gore with their scares, this is a must. But anyone who was frightened by Scream be warned: this is an entirely different proposition.",1
" What do you do when you're confronted with maybe the most wonderfully strange, most magically enchanting, most heartachingly romantic movie you've ever seen?",1
 It may not match the original classic but the fast-paced story holds its own.,1
 One of the best horror movies of 2002,1
" Russell Crowe's directorial debut is a solid, old-fashioned piece of film-making set in Australia and Turkey during the First World War and its aftermath that is guilty of some strange historical oversights.",1
" Tailor-made for the K-Mart sect, K-PAX is a weepy regression fantasy for the psychologically half-conscious.",0
 This dud is too busy pointing fingers at the people it thinks are ruining Hollywood to realize that the dream factory goes down one bad movie at a time - including this one.,0
 Sachs achieves a wondrously natural feel to the film that embraces complexities and contradictions while refusing to create heroes or villains,1

" Crowe's movie is like a great record album: the songs connect, and the people connect, too.",1
 Captain America: Civil War proves that Marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga.,1
 There is a curious absence of development in this film.,0

 The brilliant Wind Rises is another Miyazaki masterpiece - evidently his last. He couldn't have picked a more perfect way to sign off.,1
" The movie says keeping monsters out is one of the legends of purpose of the Great Wall. Don't Google, you won't find it. Not close to rocket science but fun if it's your thing.",1
" Greengrass' other films in this tradition are interested in how human beings react in the face of unimaginable horror. 22 July is only interested in itself and all of its verite draping can't obscure its underlying, speechifying hokum.",0
 Still one scary mother.,1
" Matt Damon is at his most relatable best in a film that has heart, drama and passion",1
" The movie never seems to make up its mind but, far worse, it never quite gets inside Betty's.",0

 An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years.,0

 This amazing compilation of videos all shot the same day around the globe is one for the ages.,1

" While the film won't be for those who like their narratives neatly laid out, those willing to experience something different are in for a compelling tug of war and outstanding performance from newcomer Howard.",1
 Some of the more annoying people you'll meet in sometime onscreen.,0
 The film's clumsy attempts to give its characters some emotional depth feel tacked-on and disingenuous.,0
" West's slick, fairly faithful new remake gives partial screenplay credit to Lewis John Carlino, who wrote the original ""Mechanic."" But the picture isn't likely to do for Jason Statham what the 1972 film did for Bronson.",0
" A robust, sinewy production that honours the film's enduring themes and proves that it has stood the test of time.",1
" If anything, the conventional pop-up scares and gross-out effects of this British haunted-space-ship story seem less terrifying than quaint.",0
" Story-wise, ""The Tribe"" is yet another art-film wallow in cruelty, not nearly as unique as its looks and its world.",0
 Ruggles could be a funny comedian at the right time and place. He was most definitely not in the right time and place. ,0
" Watching here feels akin to peeking at a private love letter from an artist to his art, an experience that will fascinate some and off-put many.",0
 It's all a metaphor involving a small group of suicidal women who are sent to on the most a critical planet saving mission. The movie like the mission was never going to succeed.,0
" Kids will enjoy it because its air of barely controlled chaos never tips into anything genuinely scary. Adults will enjoy it because, under the one-liners, it understands the emotional power of nostalgia: a return to a place where you know you are loved.",1
 [The] 2007 remake delivers a lot of laughs despite the fact we're clearly supposed to root for and feel sorry for the cad ... no matter how squirmy or awful his actions.,0
" With all these folks in the same movie, there are inevitably moments when Hoffman or Wilson get a laugh, but on the whole it's the same again but weaker and with fewer good jokes.",0
" Through its audacious and confrontational conceit, Killing offers piercing insights into the minds of murderers.",1
" Duff is a charming heroine who carries the movie cheerfully, if not gracefully-the pratfalls come early and often.",1
" To its great credit, ""Boy Erased"" never reduces Jared's parents to monolithic, backwards-thinking caricatures.",1
" Faggedaboutit, just throw on some of Four Seasons' many songs (including several excellent numbers that couldn't be pigeonholed awkwardly into this narrative) as a far better way of getting to what made these guys so memorable in the first place.",0
 The result is mixed.,0
" New Moon indeed feels new, often in ways that are good for the series.",1
" It allows Lumet to remind us, in his own voice, of the passion in his ostensible dispassion - the way he deftly subsumed self-expression within the brisk rhythms of his material and the superb performances of his actors.",1
" Points for consistency, I guess, on the part of Harold & Kumar creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.",0
" This thoughtful thriller takes a fresh look, through a girl's eyes, at a mystery usually treated in a more lurid style . . .of how Nazis hid in plain sight in Argentina.",1
" Deyn gives a vivid performance as the daughter, a quiet but determined survivor in a patriarchal society; whenever she steps out into the wider world, the movie soars. ",1
" Brantley and Reilly keep their story moving nimbly, melding period and genre like old hands, despite this being their first screenplay.",1
" Cooper stomps around ineffectually, Stevens makes for a blandly tame suitor, and Browning is unable to ignite any chemistry with either. The scenery is stunning. But the swooning has all the heat of a midwinter's swim.",0
 Visually dazzling but the rest is poisoned by mediocrity ,0
" Recalling one of those exploitation flicks so popular in 70s drive-ins, everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for producing such a fearless British movie. If only it was better.",0
" Bigelow tells the story very well, very efficiently, but doesn't really say much about it, which is ironic given the response to the film in some quarters.",1
" Gravely intense and the work of a man as deeply committed to his subject as one could hope for or, for that matter, want.",1
 Entertaining and continues to cross lines you never thought it would cross.,1
" It is, quite simply, a good story told in an entertaining, imaginative and heartfelt way. Now come on, DreamWorks; was that really so difficult?",1
 Here's the bottom line: Denis Cooverman might love Beth Cooper. But I don't.,0
" Isle of Dogs is pure Wes Anderson in all the best ways. It is a smart and funny story, filled with nuance and idiosyncrasy; charming and quirky and beautiful to look at. A weird, wonderful delight.",1
 ... (Proof) pushes the story beyond a mere romantic entanglement... into one of finding (one's) direction and the confidence to pursue it...,1
" With moments of true greatness and strong performances, the film still ultimately fails to live up to its potential for surprising reasons, while still being one of this year's most fascinating films to think about and discuss.",0
" There's such a simple grace to the animation in Long Way North that deserved a simpler, more graceful story.",1
 Laurence Olivier directed and stars in this astonishing Shakespeare adaptation.,1

" [Safe House] is utterly predictable stuff, in case you haven't already figured that out by now.",0
" Saw III may not be the scariest, or most successful horror film ever made, but if you're looking for your pound of fright fan flesh, you'll get a nice craven corpse-full with this shockingly sick flick.",1
" It doesn't play things too safe, nor does it get too creative, but there's something undeniably genuine about the characterizations and the core narrative that can't be dismissed.",1
 Brilliant classic of mind-game suspense.,1
 It's tractable to forego complaints when the laughs and action maintain a smile on our faces.,1
" Good intentions aside, Tucker and codirector Petra Epperlein only further confuse the issue: Their rap-video stylings and use of non-source music create the impression that you're watching characters trapped in a Tom Clancy Xbox game.",1
" This is certainly not a must see, but if you want to escape from the summer blockbuster, there are weddings far worse than this you could attend.",1
 Sometimes you can tell a lot by a title.,1
 What's the point of creating such defiantly unlikable characters if you're just going to declaw them and give them hearts of gold before the closing credits roll? A better title might have been Girls Gone Mild.,0
" It's a confusing mishmash of irrelevance, not least because Mike Leigh, the writer and director, feels the need to jump in and out of hundreds of different locations without ever exploring them.",0
" There's much more to it than there seems, thanks to a wonderfully layered performance by Wasikowska...one of the brightest young talents acting today.",1
" Trying too hard to be cool with a string of tricks each more ridiculous than the next, the flashy caper proves anything but magical.",0
" As brash, spectacular and energetic as its immediate predecessor, but without novelty on its side ",0
" I'm glad Depp and Thompson were so close, and I'm sure Hunter would have been touched by the tribute. But that doesn't make it any fun for the rest of us to watch.",0
" The nicest thing that you can say about it is that it isn't quite as contemptuous of its audience as the incredibly lazy and unnecessary ""Saw V"" was.",0
 Alleged comedy relief comes in the form of racist jokes and gags about the male fear of sanitary products. You have been warned.,0
" If you want to see a family film that tries to make kids laugh by throwing lots of loud scenes with obnoxious characters doing annoying things and features the latest crappy pop songs, then MADAGASCAR 3 is for you. ",0

" Limp, cheaply made.",0
 Lackluster 3D effects will dampen the trick-or-treat holiday enthusiasm.,0
" The film explores the psychology of female role-play with depth and intelligence, and the performances are outstanding -- Binoche brings her expected ethereal complexity, and Stewart cuts through her aura like vinegar through grease.",1
 The film reaches right out to grab us by the neck and squeeze hard.,1

" It's a really, really fun movie. ",1

 The film is more successful as an exercise in style than it is as a gripping observation of the real world.,1
 a whole lot of escapist enjoyment.,1
 Much of the pleasure of this wily cinematic exercise is watching Soderbergh and his crew bury the complex plot line's points under what appear to be a willfully perverse series of in-jokes and such.,1
" Earns some really nice chills, especially once we hit the big finale.",1
" Stale, unfunny, painfully dull, asinine and charmless. It's the antithesis of everything that a truly great romantic comedy ought to be.",0
 Serves as a reminder of how much fun the first Pirates movie was and how desperately the franchise has been working to recapture that feeling ever since. ,0
" The soundtrack is fantastic and Samuel eminently watchable, but ""Asthma"" suffers from near-lethal doses of self-satisfied hipness.",0
" Utterly unnecessary, ham-fisted remake of a supposed 1980s ""classic.""",0
" It really is ""Aliens'' on the open plains, ""Independence Day'' for the nation's centennial, and what the movie lacks in originality and stick-to-your-ribs Western authenticity, it makes up for in pell-mell multiplex entertainment.",1
" It's not as dark as you imagine, but it will get you grinning.",1
" Backstabbing For Beginners is a mesmerizing, intense watch with beautiful acting and powerful directing.",1
" The movie pretty much a win, especially for LaBeouf, since there are no CGI sentient robots swiping all the best lines and no sacred franchises or Walgreens destroyed.",1
 The Happy Prince turns out to be an unhappy experience for all concerned.,0
" Too violent for youngsters and so poorly written it won't engage an older audience, it seems to be targeted towards youthful nerds nursing overwhelming revenge fantasies.",0
" ...there's nothing so enticing as being allowed a glimpse into a hidden world of power and privilege, and Molly's world is certainly that...",1
 It's possible that one of the reasons why the film wasn't nominated for a best-documentary Oscar was because it was too horrifying.,1
" If only Bad Education engaged the heart as much as the head, Almodovar's fractured tale might have risen above its alienating noir conventions.",0

" The film has its moments, but is it the film Martin Landau deserved as his farewell performance? ",1
" Ironically, Alien 3 is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick.",1
" Hopefully with this, his second critical flop within two months, Sparks will think thrice before hurting us again. This last song? A requiem.",0
" The dialogue is inappropriately jocular throughout, which undercuts the genuine terror it attempts to muster.",0
" Not bad for what it is, but what is--it never lets you forget -- is a self-aware, self-absorbed TV movie. ",1
 The film is merely a myopic footnote that cannot match its own nonsensical raucous tone.,0
" Mr. Holmes is a slow-moving film, but it's beautiful in its movement.",1
" Law gives a bravura performance that poleaxes, once and for all, the notion that he is still best suited to pretty-boy roles.",1
" Starring Italian comedian Roberto Benigni as the new bumbling inspector, it is a tired pastiche of recycled sketches and gags.",0
" A lack of structural ebbs and flows throughout the screenplay takes away from the film's real potential. Nevertheless Tatum's presence still makes the film watchable, if not magical.",0
" [A] methodical, unmissable takedown.",1
" A clone of Ribert Fiveson's 1979 'The Clonus Horror', but is imaginative, gripping, and foretelling.",1

" This film takes a look at love in the future in a funny, intelligent and non melodramatic way.",1
" It's a very August sort of movie, the kind that benefits from low, lax expectations.",0
" ""Tomorrowland"" ... wants to stress the importance of the people in our midst who dream big but, instead, buries those very people under a lecture avalanche. The result is a movie about wonder that has virtually no sense of wonder of its own.",0
" One of the most relentlessly intense, gut-churning portrayals of escalating madness ever captured on screen.",1
" Any film that trashes the talent of Carrie Fisher is a loser in my book and this one stomps up and down on her talent. Don't worry Carrie, I still remember Leia.",0
 It's clear almost immediately that writer/director Theresa Bennett isn't looking to explore uncharted territory here...,0
 Antics of a diabolical child are neither valuable nor funny.,0
" The mood lurches around a bit, and the film itself feels a bit diluted -- as if Kevin Smith were doing Judd Apatow doing Kevin Smith. And Smith, and his fans, are far too original to settle for that for long.",0
" Aching to be magical, the picture instead comes off as a 'Wonderful World of Disney' retread on steroids...what might have been heart-on-sleeve becomes bleeding heart instead.",0
 You know a picture's derivative when a list of titles in the same genre technically constitutes a spoiler. It's not so much that these films provide the picture's DNA as that Kosinski uses them as his personal cinematic ATM. ,0
" Though Lee's deft expertise keeps things pacy and (mostly) plausible, the material can't avoid a certain predictability and, in the end, a preachy sentimentality.",0
" Brother's Nest will make you laugh, hold tight to the armrest of your seat, and then cry with its tale of a dysfunctional family.",1

 Carberry and Tweel never condescend to their hella-Southern subjects. And that's why Finders Keepers gives them a leg to stand on.,1
 Man of Steel's schizophrenic structure acts as a microcosm for both the profoundly philosophical and the profoundly thuggish dialectic at the heart of the Superman legend.,1
" Ultimately, Wonder is just a sweet film, less about Auggie than it is a portrait of a small group of everyday people with interconnected lives and dreams and struggles. ",1
" We continue to reflect on the movie's lessons long after the laughs have diminished because they are sound, relevant and conveyed by the talents of actors who offer legitimate stakes in the material.",1
 Turns out to be much more complex than the originally released gem.,1
 The opening act is too magnificent for the terrible ending to wreck it.,1

" A clumsy, inept debut film from the pop culture pre-fab phenomenon.",0
" As a satire on Tinseltown, it's toothless.",0

 Y'all NEED to see this film. Just be prepared to get emotional and mourn the loss of a man who devoted his life to being kind.,1
" Animated alien movie has potty humor, bullying. ",1
 A glorious feast of a movie that is unlike anything else you will see this year.,1
 Cowperthwaite juxtaposes to devastating effect official PR spin with news reports and eye-witness accounts of marine park tragedies.,1
" Despite its flaws, The Zookeeper's Wife is the kind of handsomely-mounted melodrama that will inspire many to bemoan the fact that they don't make them like this anymore.",1
" Appropriate Behaviour has an indulgent, slightly precious autobiographical feel - but it is funny, risky and in exhilaratingly bad taste.",1
" The powerfully acted The Hunt concerns itself with how an innocent individual is caught up in a modern-day witch-hunt, based solely on the false memories of a child.",1
 [Director Ognjen] Glavonic's film... manages to transmit all the darkness and mournful silence that surrounds its creatures... [Full review in Spanish],1

 The attempt at grittiness comes off soft.,0
" Unlike ""Psycho"" or ""Shutter Island"", a realistic and moving depiction of the life of a schizophrenic. It not only succeeds as drama but as a social statement badly needed to educate a public so used to stigmatizing those who are ill.",1
 A sobering sci-fi thriller about the race to communicate with intelligent alien life to avert disaster.,1
" Dull it is not, but Wong's trademark sense of romantic melancholy fails to jell amid all the excess.",0
" The offenses of Confessions of a Shopaholic are legion, but worst is its portrayal of women as easily crazed, irrational dopes.",0
" Despite the music in James Lapine's documentary, Six By Sondheim, it is archival clips of Mr. Sondheim describing how he writes that make the film a treasure. ",1
" Wong is a master of small, melancholy moments that appear to contain all the beauty and sadness of the world, a strength The Grandmaster plays to only rarely-but when it does, the effect is mesmerizing.",1
" I will not apologize for giving this movie a strong Matinee with Snacks rating. I came out of it all pumped and gleeful and satisfied, and if anyone wants much more than that from a Terminator movie, well, it also has some freaking great sequences and ef",1
" If Swinton and Hiddleston have a shared gift, it's the ability to inhabit theatricality naturally.",1
" If Night Watch is energetic, it is also frenetic; if neatly plotted, it is also too open-ended, a set-up for the remaining two installments of a trilogy.",0
" Warren Beatty hardly seems the desperado type, but Faye Dunaway is convincing in her role as his companion in robbery and murder.",1
" Sometimes, history doesn't have to repeat itself.",0
" On rare occasions, a movie comes along that does genuine honor to Alfred Hitchcock. Take Shelter is such a movie. It could be subtitled ""Take Shelter with Hitch.""",1
 Major props must go to the film's production team for recreating the sounds & looks of the 1970s with such matter-of-fact precision...Some of the suburban street scenes look so authentic it's as though they were filmed with the aid of a time machine. ,1

" It's closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality.",1
" Brace! Brace! Smart entertainment from Zemeckis, superior acting from DW.",1
" It's not exactly sophisticated aesthetically or thematically, being another skeptical morality play on the dangers of biotechnological advancements that seek to erase our humanity, but Upgrade is quite a likable bit of pulp.",1
" Fans of the first two ""American Pie"" movies should definitely come back for a third slice. Everyone else might want to cautiously poke at it with a fork first.",0

 It's tempting then to call this U.S.-British-produced endeavor an odd duck. Except that Valiant uses nearly every pun in the book.,0
" The laughs suddenly cease after a brutal rape sequence, and Dunne desperately and vainly tries to re-work the remainder of the movie as a metaphysical coming-of-age story.",0
" Ant-Man and the Wasp has a pleasingly breakneck, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't surreal glee. It's a cunningly swift and delightful comedy of scale.",1
" A dumb, blandly sloganeering love letter to blind faith and willful denial.",0
 Swanberg's careful eye perceives the nuances of those conflicts with greater perspicacity than ever before; never have his tiny moments of truth felt so honest or clear.,1

" It's fine, and on occasion it even flirts with looney tune greatness, but mostly it's held back by predictability.",1
 Jackson managed to do something that I never thought was possible--make me care about a Hobbit tale. He also delivered one of the best cliffhangers of the year. Kudos to that.,1
" But for all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit.",0
" However many screaming teenagers it produces at the multiplexes, Eight Legged Freaks isn't good or funny enough to reinvigorate the style. It can't even maintain its own initial zing.",0
" While it might not be as much of a cinematic train wreck as 2006's X-Men: The Land Stand, it's not quite the rousing, spectacular summer movie season opener we were hoping for, either.",0
" If you have any ear for non-Western music, Gypsy Caravan is a must.",1

 Viewers who make it through the dire early scenes may be surprised by the quality of the later ones.,0
 So turgid and enervated that it's more likely to generate snores than shudders.,0
" Preaching to the choir, but that's no bad thing.",1
" When Mike Enslin (John Cusack) says he does not believe in ghosts, we in the audience cannot be blamed for not wishing him well, but he does turn in a stellar performance in what largely a stagey, one-man show.",1
 There is a serious voodoo swirling around in [Only Lovers Left Alive] that you will not find anywhere else in any other vampire movie. That power will stick with you long after the lights go up.,1
" The movie offers a lesson in minimalist drama, unfolding as a sharply acted mood piece that never crescendos, but hums along with wise observations and first-rate performances.",1
 Visual wonders are just a mind-blowing bonus in a film which uses character-driven hero stories to make something incredibly smart.,1
 [The] character has given Giamatti another great role after Sideways and Harvey Pekar and he runs with it; no wonder he won a Golden Globe for this.,1
" Most of the time Black Panther delivers a masterful new take on the superhero origin story, fresh in its perspective and energetic in its plotting. I highly recommend.",1
" Here is still another illustration of the old Hollywood noir principle that a movie lives its life not through its hero, but within its shadows.",1
" A loud movie with lots of giant shiny things, ""Pacific Rim: Uprising,"" is a CGI spectacle of crushing metal played against a background of tough kids and one-liners. Think of it as ""Real Steel"" without Hugh Jackman. ",0
" All things considered, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is not bad. It's a serviceable spectacle, with plenty of action.",0

" Ferrell, in need of a shorter leash, never makes the character any more than a caricature, and Kidman, in a rare comedic role, suffers, too.",0
 Napoleon Dynamite is like watching Todd Solondz kick a dog on Nickelodeon,0

 Mere words cannot adequately describe Kevin Smith's film - only obscene gestures.,0
" The performances are worth the experience, more so than a story that doesn't deliver the amount of insight or enlightenment it thinks.",1
 It's a little bit corny and sometimes too in love with its own cleverness - but it's also the most fun I've had at the movies this year.,1
 The most interesting aspect of the film is its depiction of the irreconcilable difference between someone's public and private personae.,1

 Believe the hype: Richard Linklater's decade-in-the-making epic is a remarkable achievement. ,1
 It's remarkable how Lindsay and Martin were able to take from all these disparate sources and build such a clear narrative through line.,1

 A Touching and Courageous True Life Story,1
 It moves in fits and starts and never finds the rhythmic pitter-patter of rapid-fire dialogue and energy it so desperately wants.,0

 It's the children (Emily Browning and Liam Aiken as the confident Violet and the thoughtful Klaus) who really steal this show...,1

" John Malkovich and Josh Brolin are too good for the sloppy, overripe Jonah Hex. ",0
" The eerie displacement of being at large in alien territory is the guiding emotion in Jarmusch's movies, and in none more so than this one.",1
" Waititi, who wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Barry Crump, is pretty fearless in his tonal palette ... It's not your conventional, conservative kid's flick, to its definite credit.",1

" Indie actress/screenwriter Lister-Jones makes her directing debut here, and while the characters' frequent arguing makes it a less-than-pretty experience, it's impressively, emotionally real. ",1
" One part Gothic fantasy, one part softcore thriller... blurs the line between highbrow and sexploitation so skilfully you will be left wondering if you just watched a big-budget skin flick or a particularly smutty arthouse production.",1
" Scripted by Crank scribes Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, and starring a game Josh Brolin, this probably looked good on paper.",0
" The key to the film's success is Ralph Fiennes, who does a dazzling job of portraying three of the sons of the house of Sonnenschein...",1
" The picture is nothing, really, that you haven't seen before, but it's the definition of a square, competent, deliver-the-goods blockbuster.",1
 It says something about the film that it's impossible to watch without imagining the even moister American remake.,0
" It's genuinely shocking when the funny, satirical film you'd expect from a film by Jon Stewart emerges late in the first film by Jon Stewart. ",1

 You've never seen anything like Repo! The Genetic Opera. Not that you'd want to.,0
" Way too much to absorb in 2 hours, and it results in a talky, sanitized, often boring, tragicomedy that begins to fade from memory as soon as you leave the theater.",0
" Much like this film's main character, you can't quite explain what's got you so afraid -- you just know that you are.",1

 Is there anything more frustrating than a movie that wants to make you cry but fails to finish the job?,0
" As close to unwatchable as cinema gets, Harmony Korine's latest stab at alienating his audience seems perversely designed to test the loyalty of those who stuck with the underground auteur through Gummo and Mister Lonely.",0
 That Spielberg refuses to go after bigger game keeps the film a banal exercise in sentimentality.,0
" Like ""Foot Fist,"" ""Observe and Report"" is about grating, dysfunctional males and the sluts they love and inappropriate behavior alone does not equal comedy.",0
 The documentary of the year may also be its most hair-raising thriller.,1
 You'll either be on board or utterly bemused and disengaged - it fully depends on your tolerance or desire for the offbeat...but this is STILL a poor movie.,0
" Perhaps Britain's most beloved cult film, Bruce Robinson's 1986 semi-autobiographical dark comedy is an obsessively observed character study. ",1

 Goonies meets LOTR in fun but sometimes scary adventure. ,1
" Jia's still clearly an immense talent, but there's still much about his oeuvre that doesn't quite work.",0
" It speaks to viewers with disparate reactions, but it also speaks to anyone who didn't dig into the scandal at the time by outlining what happens when we are too quick to defend the famous faces instead of those claiming to be victimized by them.",1
" Johnny English is silly enough, but why can't this clever man make a clever movie?",0
" I couldn't figure out what these two movies - one larkish but trivial, the other emotionally ambitious - have to do with one another. Neither, apparently, could Turturro.",0
" Foul thriller, filled with depravity.",0
" [Bennett] Miller refuses to go for the cheap thrills, but in so doing, he forgets to give us any thrills. ",0
 My criticism lies in the fact that Peedom has included every potential controversy instead of concentrating on ... the integral role of the Sherpa and the 360 million dollar tourist industry it enables,0
" If not for the similar Austin Powers movies, maybe a lot of what's in this film would have played better, and fresher. But as it stands, it looks old hat.",0

" A glum, by-the-numbers potboiler distinguished only by its admittedly handsome production values.",0
" The movie belongs entirely to Bridges, who won the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama. His inimitable Jeff-isms have never been more endearing - the sloppy gait, the whiskey glass balanced on his chest, his general air of discombobulation.",1

 Kidman and Eckhart give stellar performances in a quiet tale of grief and (perhaps) healing.,1

" 27 Dresses is a closet full of tired, bursting with characters, dynamics, and perspectives that went out of fashion many films ago.",0
" Its tone is quietly comical, with each chapter treated as an extended joke, or as an R-rated O. Henry story angling toward a neat concluding twist.",1
" Betts has put together a talented acting ensemble, and the performances are, for the most part, uniformly good and subtle, particularly among the actresses who play the young novices.",1
 Mortensen is more than partly responsible for the movie's charms.,1

 A work of beauty with a surprising capacity to be cute and cunning.,1

 Even non-rugby fans will know how it ends but it's worth the nostalgic pain to keep watching until the final siren.,1

 More dull than dark. ,0
" Lays one big, though colorful, Easter egg.",0
" The film ping-pongs between wacky comedy and heavy drama, and it is so heavy on plot and character that it takes on a sitcomlike quality.",0
" Paddington 2 stands out for its atmosphere of homey cheer and profound belief in the harmonizing power of warmth, politeness, and the absurd.",1

 The biggest mystery about Halloween: H20 is why the filmmakers bothered to send it to theaters.,0
" The thrill isn't gone from the sequel, but the surprise is, and it hurts more than you'd think.",1
 Passably endearing despite its sometimes pronounced shortcomings.,0

 Ultimately a forgettable entry in the young-adult genre.,0
 Incredible action setpieces more than make up for the slow gaps. ,1

 Modest in the least engaging sense of the term.,0
 The movie is disappointing.,0

 The image Brewer leaves us with is powerful. ,1
" This infectiously entertaining summer movie makes you feel good. It provides hope that a fresh start is possible regardless of age. Hanks has oodles of charm, and he and Roberts have great chemistry. The real find in the acting arena is... ",1
 The foundation of a much better movie is buried somewhere beneath the debris that's too quickly piled on to The Kings of Summer ...,0

 Its grimy authenticity clicks like a rusty mortice lock.,1
 Director Patrick Creadon collects rich material but builds a rickety structure.,0
" Berlin is gorgeously shot in black and white and scored with loose, atmospheric jazz as Niko wanders from one seemingly unrelated event to another.",1
" Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.",1

 This movie escapes from convention and always keeps you interested in its characters. [Full review in Spanish],1
 Reese Witherspoon is miscast in this poor adaptation of the popular novel.,0

" While 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes doesn't achieve the near-classic quality of 1968's original Planet of the Apes, it's close. ",1
" Given that personal trauma is the prevailing throughline of Denis Villeneuve's filmmaking career so far, it's no surprise to find Arrival anchored by a familiar narrative motif.",1
 If you are a Willis or Weaver completist then just wait until cable for this lifeless and uninspired waste. ,0
" This may be bordering on lightning bolt worthy, but... If the devil made them remake this movie, at least he could have given them a better script.",0
" While it has its moments, taken by itself, The Doors amounts to little more than an impressionistic look at a boy and his death wish.",0
" The city and the plot points wheel right by, the leads fetchingly entranced with each other. If one patch of dares disappoints, there's another coming right up, and the directors stage and shoot them with swooning neon kinecticism.",1
" Stories We Tell"" unmistakably originates from a singular vision, but also serves as a testament to what happens when individual perspectives blend into one, creating something far greater than the sum of its parts - in this case, a truly special film. ",1

" You'll definitely feel the 2-plus hours run time, but I was more than happy to do so.",1
" Pay the Ghost offers the best of both Cage worlds, giving the actor a finely etched character to play as well as an abstract, phantasmagorical cinematic canvas for him to explore.",1
" Buried is a brutal, relentless, mind-numbing thriller whose last five minutes will leave you absolutely breathless. ",1
 Despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller.,1
 That the wonderful French actor Jean Reno plays the therapist is a sign that his agent is not doing a good enough job finding him film roles in American movies.,0

 Hackneyed retread of ancient Western shtick.,0

" ""Free State of Jones"" aspires to greatness but fumbles badly.",0
" The Black Stallion is a magical fable that basks in shimmering imagery, innocent wonder and the romantic longings that we thought Hollywood had left behind in the '50s.",1
" While each entry satisfies in its own unique way, the anthology as a whole makes for an impressive examination of distaff fears and underestimated ferocity.",1
" The characters change personalities every time Freundlich gets an idea for a new gag, leading to bizarre, random behavior that is likely to inspire audience annoyance, rather than sympathy.",0
" Taking the trashy gusto exhibited in The Canyons to whole new extremes, Schrader goes full exploitation for Dog Eat Dog 's first act.",1

 Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is a larky and ultimately disposable entertainment.,0
" Action-packed, clever, funny and surprisingly tender at times, it checks all the boxes for not just an excellent buddy comedy, but an excellent movie period.",1
" Aimed squarely at the very young, this cute animation still feels far too rushed to spend any significant time on.",0

" It's entertaining in a cheerfully ridiculous way, though Cage fans will be disappointed that he does not really lose his rag, despite some serious provocation from the Lord of Darkness.",0
" The ""action"" -- most of it waiting around -- unfolds over seven days, and ultimately, 7 Days doesn't deliver much more than the TV movies of the 1970s.",0
" Nothing in this story is remotely realistic, and the target audience for urban dramas -- teenage boys -- won't know what to make of its mushy romantic center.",0
" Its hilarious, mind-bendingly stupid climax is nearly worth the price of admission alone.",1
" It starts slowly and ends very predictably. In fact, the bloopers which come before the end credits are probably the best thing about it -- and that says a lot.",0
" This film should be shown in film school the first day they discuss lighting. The attention to detail shown with light, shadow, and abscence of light are impossible to ignore even if you never notice those sort of things.",1
" Clever, crazed and contagious, The Last Showing is a film that is awash with tradition, twists, atmosphere, and charm. Does for multiplexes what Jaws did for water.",1

" [Richard Loncraine] knows how not to overstep the sentiment, suds and assorted fleet feet and let his stars soar.",1
" They speak entirely in plot points and punchlines and seem to be motivated only by lust, greed and ego. Well, we all are, but few bring to this motivation so little intelligence and wit.",0

 What ought to be a bittersweet movie about a woman's momentary unraveling feels like a workout class: Cardio melodrama.,0
 The Family Stone works hard to warm the cockles of our hearts. The cast is attractive. The sentiments are commendable. But the love Bezucha wants us to feel for the family couldn't possibly compete with the love they already feel for themselves.,0
 The third entry lacks the subtle power of the previous two efforts.,0
" This brilliant character study of a drifter and the people he takes advantage of unfolds so effortlessly, so realistically, that you experience the movie rather than watch it -- drawn easily into a fascinating, illuminating world.",1
" While it's hardly the best film of its franchise, it will do the trick until something scarier comes along.",0
" There is a sense of ambiguity at the core of The Reader that makes it all the more brutal, all the more honest in its deflowering of love and what one imagines love ought to be instead of what it too often is.",1

 I can't say that I enjoyed watching Gigli but it certainly was an instructive lesson in how good ideas can go horribly wrong.,0
 Whatever lizard-brain fun might have been had in watching Johnson do battle against a drug cartel is weakened by the occasional hard tug at the social conscience. The film winds up divided against itself.,0

 You've already seen the exact same thing in Scream 2 and Scream 3.,0
" Whether the film's ambiguous meanings strike you as profound or overblown, there's greatness enough in its aesthetic marvels: the power of its performances, the beauty of its images and the deftness of its sudden shifts.",1
 Fascinating and horrifying. A gripping detective story and an impassioned call for public debate over terrifying weapons that have already been loosed.,1

 Ghostbusters...respects its predecessor while crossing the streams into a new direction.,1

 There's apparently so little scope for exploration of this bizarre and fascinating symbiotic relationship that Fleischer decides instead to spend the first hour of the film worrying about Brock's career issues...,0

 Predictable dance melodrama with little to recommend it.,0

" Sondheim's angular, interval-hopping material feels like one continuous song interrupted by dialogue. The cast often seems to be talking over a musical score rather than singing.",0

" What LIFE OF BRIAN did so well, was take a strong narrative and dress it up with silly humor and a naked man with a long beard. YEAR ONE has nothing to fall back on here. It's like they weren't even trying.",0

" A tough, female-led thriller from the director of Twilight sounds great on paper; unfortunately, the lack of nous in Miss Bala's politics runs the film smack into a big brick wall.",0
" Despite hewing fairly closely to the facts, has trouble seeming truthful. Practically everyone behaves like an allegorical symbol rather than a person, a problem the script anticipates and acknowledges but only feebly attempts to solve. [Blu-ray]",0

 Primer has no respect for genuine mystery but relishes obfuscation as being really cool.,0
" Told in a tight 81 minutes, the well-structured adventure tale is stronger than the soft, pastel colored computer animation.",1
" The love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.",0
" The movie might leave you drained and disgusted, yet it also serves as a reminder that Palmer (whose last notable feature, ""Akeelah and the Bee,"" was 12 years ago) is an unusually intense talent who deserves a much better vehicle than this one.",0

" Sprawling, messy, yet occasionally affecting.",0
" It's an eloquent, observant and mature comedy about the decay of an era.",1
" I'd love to understand why [Marianna Palka] wants to present herself this way, but I don't. It would be easy to call it self-loathing but that seems too obvious. Yet if there was another message, it's giving way to the self-loathing interpretation.",0
" The imminence of both half-term and Halloween certainly makes for a varied batch of releases, with The Babadook firmly at the scary end of the spectrum. It is properly chilling.",1

" Firewall is a riveting suspense thriller, in the sense that after about an hour and a half of it you're still riveted by the suspense of what exactly is going on.",0

 The only thing taken in this dreadful sequel is the audience. ,0
" Gigli isn't the equivalent of cracking a whippit, but it is irredeemably flawed",0
" This mash-up makes for a curious movie, one both beholden to its many sources of inspiration, and uncertain of how to use them to pave its way forward.",0
" It Comes at Night balances on the knife edge between hope and despair, counterweighting the dire nature of its world with genuinely moving moments of warmth.",1
" It will test your concentration, resolve and butt cheeks to the limit but Winter Sleep will reward your staying power: a perfectly played, beautiful-looking, exquisitely nuanced picture.",1
 Adam McKay is polishing his path from Saturday Night Live... to this challenge of combining biography and denunciation. [Full review in Spanish],1

" A cold and intellectual look at people searching for spiritual meaning that, instead of imparting any resonant observations about faith and family, comes off as kooky and affected.",0
" Jonathan Demme's thoughtful human drama was certainly not the first movie to confront the AIDS crisis, but it was, even in the conventional skin of a courtroom drama, the most heartbreaking and passionate undertaking of its kind.",1
" The religious thrust - that life is tough to get through and being a Christian makes it a bit easier - is weak, and the film is disturbingly anti-scientific at its core.",0

 The mildly amusing Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is further proof that even the stalest whiff of brand recognition has become preferable to originality.,0

 Cheri strikes a jarring note right from the start.,0

 Director Ruben Fleischer and his team have crafted one of the most enjoyable black comedies of the year.,1

" An infectiously goofy film, but also deceptively smart about why we love comic book heroes and the amount of stupidity we're willing to accept within the genre.",1
 Gives you more reason than ever to love Black's death scene in 1997's The Jackal.,0
" Massaging every demographic, this admittedly fast, funny and robustly acted progeny of The Rock exploits actions of killers and rapists -- then cynically sells family values with a lengthy wrap-up ballad.",0

" Anderson is still a maddeningly cool filmmaker. He's remote from his characters, which makes him remote from his movies. There's also a way in which he uses race as a novelty, suggesting an assertively white-kid view of the world.",0
" Parts of the movie are luridly enthralling, and its ugliness is strangely appealing (at least to people with a high tolerance for such things). Yet it pushes too many buttons and is filled with so many false endings that eventually it becomes tiresome.",0

" I very much tolerated Hotel Transylvania. It's pretty much an Adam Sandler film for kids. Cursing and vulgarities are replaced by wackiness and farts. Yes, I laughed at the barrage of silliness. I may be an adult, but I'm still human. ",1
 John Milius's 1984 cult classic about American teens battling a Soviet invasion has been reinvented as a Tea Party wet dream that offers a scathing (if completely illogical) indictment of the federal government.,0

 Director Mark Newton has learned B-moviemaking's most important lesson: Personality doesn't cost a dime.,1
" Trouble with the Curve exceeds the sum of its parts. An imperfect movie, it has modest flaws and inconsistencies one can point to. But in the theater with the light flickering, it all just works.",1
" Director Joshua Oppenheimer shines a light on one of the 20th century's most under-reported atrocities, but his film, years in the making, is so much more than a straightforward history lesson.",1

 DreamWorks Animation's best movie since Shrek.,1

 Suburbicon might be the most contemporary period piece I've ever seen. ,1
" The Winter Soldier features an unusually complex plot for a comic book flick, and a where-to-go-from-here conclusion bating fanboys' breath. Not everything's clockwork but ambition counts for something.",1
" For Here or to Go? follows the rom-com template a little too closely at times ... but makes up for it both for the issues it raises, and an ending that defies expectations in a very satisfying way. ",1
 Diane Lane and John Cusack have such terrific chemistry together in the genial romantic comedy Must Love Dogs that it's a wonder these two veteran performers have never been teamed before.,1
 Two words. Marge Gunderson.,1
 Another likable -- if predictable -- Disney retread.,1

" Green Book has a race problem, but it delivers cringeworthy depictions of women and gay men too.",0
" ""No Escape"" is really a horror film at heart, the Dowdles effectively using the tricks of the trade to build dread in the viewer. It's just that, instead of a serial killer or a demon, the boogeyman this time is an entire country.",0
 Really well done.,1
 The plot has to pause after every meager action scene to express its feelings.,0
" this putative sequel is different in every way: a short-and-sweet genre-blurring gross-out, freak-out, all-out comedy, that switches the original's genders while utterly lowering the tone.",1
" It's one of those movies that make me go, ""why did I watch this?""",0
 We already knew about the human appetite for evil. The Look of Silence addresses something more slippery and banal: our endless capacity for evasion.,1
" Even with its numerous issues, the film remains a must-watch for movie lovers and anyone who appreciates filmmakers who take bold steps in uncharted directions to tell stories in unconventional ways. ",1
" For all its attempts at eroticism, the movie is aggressively uninteresting.",0
" With no discernible axis on which to see things turn and a refusal to ground the narrative in a place where characters behave slightly recognisably to the real world, there is nothing to hold on to throughout this preposterous, contrived outing.",0
 The result is ludicrous self-parody - somewhere between a Calvin Klein aftershave advertisement and a coffee-table book about the modernist mansions of the rich and famous.,0
" It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but this mixture of magical realism and bittersweet absurdity benefits from a consistency of vision and a genuinely unusual storytelling approach.",1
 The film itself is one of surprising conscience...,1
" Acclaimed writer Luc Besson (The Professional, Taken, The Fifth Element) co-writes another action-packed movie that even with a few outrageous moments is still a smart, sexy thriller with a good story that propels Saldana's star power.",1
" Promising pedigree aside, this nonsensical romance's a laborious entertainment. ",0
" Clever, believable, and super fun to watch. It totally has replay value.",1
 An early scene in which a street artist reveals a Herge portrait of Tintin calls our attention to the contrast between the wit and economy of the original drawings and the labor-intensive kitsch of the performance-capture images.,0

" Every time the film inches into compelling territory, the band backs away to avoid offending anyone.",0
" ... an impressive technical achievement that features some amusing snippets, but despite a feisty underdog spirit, it becomes overloaded with quirks and hyperactivity.",0
" ""Are You Here"" takes a similarly violent and occasionally ridiculous and bewildering path towards finding inner peace, but when it does, it's deeply satisfying.",1
 Crowe and director Peter Weir have thrown the cliche overboard and replaced them with great storytelling. Run -- don't walk. I liked it so much i wanted to enlist.,1
" Director/writer Woody Allen still has vitality, creativity, and the man can write.",1
" Often inspired, occasionally insipid, altogether uneven.",0
" The Losers plays like a grungy, sweaty action movie with all the energy sucked out of it. If while you're sitting in the theater watching it, you suspect that someone might have pumped Valium into the air conditioning vents, you're not alone.",0
" The novelty of a raunchy adults-only cartoon has a naughty charge. That's good for about 15 minutes, then all this food reaches its sell-by date and grows stale.",0
 The success of The Disaster Artist is less a thoughtful almost-adaptation and more a testament to one man and his quest for greatness - even if it means being the worst of the best. ,1
" ""Real Steel"" is a real movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a compelling plot. This is the sort of movie, I suspect, young viewers went to the ""Transformers"" movies looking for.",1
" For the most part, it's an act of big-screen worship. As drama, this one would have been better had it been a little more willing to go into the rough.",0
" Jurassic Park doesn't have organic flow; it can't disguise its clunky, B-movie soul.",0
" This clumsy, cheesy, chintzy adaptation, with its F/X that look dated the moment you see them, is like something left over from the '60s, the heyday of Marvel's longest-running series.",0
" A violent, grungy, Peckinpah-lite action thriller that's worth checking out just to be reminded how powerful an actor Mel Gibson continues to be-even if the parts aren't coming like they once were.",1
" It's a great surprise that The Good Thief actually works, leaving Melville behind and giving us the vibrant, exciting work of another interesting director, Neil Jordan.",1
" There are many stunning special effects, including a car chase up the side of a building, as well as the sort of wild animated subtitles that turned up in Night Watch.",1
 If Cruise's fantasy superhero garners as many staunch fans ... we may be witnessing the birth of a new franchise.,1
" A coarse, rickety comedy.",0
" There is no soul, and no heart to the story. A good sci-fi is never merely about the effects, it's about the plot, character and thoughts they bring to life, all of which Valerian lacks in abundance.",0

" A warm and witty, detailed look at this parallel universe.",1
" Hawke has more of a mountain to climb when it comes to being convincing as an ordinary Nova Scotia bod, but even he comes good by the end.",1

" The Judge is a tale of family dysfunction, the sins of the father and all that.",0
" An ultra-lite version of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Inherent Vice,"" ""Once Upon a Time in Venice"" is a sunny SoCal noir so inconsequential it seems to evaporate as it plays out.",0
 Russell Crowe proves himself master of the motion picture epic genre once again in a sea-faring picture sure to get you cheering.,1
 The Hangover now bests the Iron Man franchise by a half-star (8-7.5 total) in my book. So there's that.,1

" More than anything, Slender Man is just boring. And he shouldn't be.",0
 Gyllenhaal brings utter commitment to his character (but the film's) homey little demolition trope becomes...a distraction for the viewer.,0
 It's a woozily photographed portrait of humanity in extremis that pushes hot buttons with abandon; spare a thought in particular for the small boy who sips the sangria and is then locked in a room on his own.,1
" With newcomer Noujaim (who was a Harvard roommate of Tuzman), they once again pull off a coup in what is essentially an art of creative noticing.",1
 A one note affair about the ravages of war in which beautiful people are dirtied up and walk around idyllic landscapes while bad things happen all around them...,0

 Eddie Murphy steals the show in 'Tower Heist',0
 What had been loose-limbed and affable curdles into something unpleasant and disturbing. It left me wondering where the good movie went.,0
 Methodical and mesmerizing,1
 What makes Oculus ingenious is how Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard take this hackneyed storyline and twist it - round 'n' round - ad infinitum into a dizzying corkscrew of a narrative.,1

" A film about film history may sound dry, but the stories captured here crackle with life and enthusiasm.",1
" A forceful, bruising experience that's good at conveying shell-fire mercilessness, but dramatically less effective when dealing with the small stuff.",0
 It's not [Jackson's] Technicolor screensaver design for heaven that really dents the credibility of the film. It's that he glosses over those parts of story which made Sebold's book so relatable for us mortals.,0
" A delight, with a sharp script of surprises and a finely bewildered lead performance from Anna Margaret Hollyman contributing to an amusing, vaguely horrifying journey into psychological paralysis.",1
 Praise be to Goose the Cat; I look forward to his inevitable solo film.,1
" This is not a film that leaves you in hand-wringing despair. Rather it is unapologetically on the optimistic side, telling us in no uncertain terms that ""we can stop climate change.""",1
 Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi relies too hard on obvious attempts at humour at the expense of the Chinese characters.,0
" The film is always fun, but as Carroll might have observed, it's not much of a muchness.",0
" Spiral is an interesting experiment in the evocation of things that do not actually exist, and it succeeds with sizzle.",1
" The script, by Lee, Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, is tighter than those for other Lee movies, but it's still too long and too broad.",0
 The humour doesn't flow naturally from either the plot or the setting -- the best gags are the ones that are just tossed into the picture and would be at home anywhere.,0
" Busby berekeley's first musical in color is as lurid and eccentric as you would expect, and it's no surpirse that it's become a classic camp, largely due to Carmen Miranda's bananas number.",1
" ""The Lone Ranger"" is a frustrating exercise in overkill, a kind-of, sort-of interesting idea buried in summer-movie excess.",0
" If only The Silent Partner had been less sexy-thriller frolics and more sexual politics, it could have been a Hitchcockian neo-noir of real interest.",0
" ""Cloud Atlas"" is a film where the creators' admirable reach exceeds their grasp. You may be getting six films for the cost of one, but it may not really be worth the price.",0

 It's an incredibly well put-together movie just from every aspect.,1
" After a thrilling 100 minutes, Peele's ambitions do get the best of him - he can't quite close it out and the film's messy final 15 minutes feel overtly expository. Alas, it turns out that ""Us,"" quite ironically, is also confused about its own identity.",1

 A huge disappointment and a wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish],0

 Evolves into an unforgettably inspirational film filled with joy and disarming honesty.,1

" The first film (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") had a slightly more engrossing plot...Still, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is an effective cinematic take on a book series that has challenging things to say.",1
" It is an awkward, cynical film that clearly knows little about the romantic comedies its main character says she despises.",0
" At its best, ""War Machine"" crackles with irreverent wit, even if American political craziness circa 2009 looks tame compared with the 2017 version.",1
" Richly, imaginatively rendered, deeply textured and almost overwhelming. This film drops you into an outer space world that knows no limits on space, time and dimensionality, and asks the viewer to go along for this deeply weird roller coaster ride.",1
 The legendary British novelist is probably turning over in his grave at being associated with this witless farrago.,0
 This is one of those rare opportunities to be reminded of how exhilarating genuinely inspired laughter can feel. This is the End is the year's current champion of funny.,1
" Unlike a more conventional refugee documentary - shot by an outsider parachuting in - this is an intimate and ongoing study in which the family have complete agency, lending the film an additional ring of truth.",1
" What she demonstrates in ""Somewhere"" is an ability to bottle these moments, to create these tiny little pockets of memory and mood that you can dip into, each one a full sensory experience",1

 Funny at times and touches on some interesting issues. But the Jersey caricature is so embarrassing that it ultimately sinks the film.,0
 Meandering and maudlin and drearily predictable ...,0
 We just don't learn enough to compensate for feeling so little.,0

" A movie of small charms and sumptuous malaise. Even if you can appreciate its elaborate posing, there's never a lavish emotionalism which sweeps you along.",0
" Director Rob Meltzer, who made the kind-of-amusing meta short ""I Am Stamos,"" directs things in shameless, let's-get-this-thing-over-with style ...",0
" Although this '80s flashback has an appealing sheen of sweetness, it sticks so closely to the rhythms of remembrance that it lacks dramatic impact. We've heard this story too many times before.",0
" As a trailblazing figure, Ruth Bader Ginsburg deserves a knockout biopic about her life. Instead she gets... a serviceable, but by no means extraordinary origin story of a pre-Supreme Court RBG as she begins to shape her legacy.",0
" A patchy assemblage of familiar 'girls gone wild' shtick, weighed down by a dark twist that ultimately proves inconsequential and glib observations about female friendship.",0
" As fun as the movie occasionally is, it can't make its own drama convincing, much less give Reynolds the nudge he needs toward Matt Damon-ville.",0
" I, Robot is far less concerned with bellowing an Orwellian socio-political warning than with giving Will Smith enough robots to bash apart and send flying across elaborate sets.",0
 A Star Is Boring.,0
" In Holy Motors director Leos Carax demonstrates that playful can be profound, bewildering can be meaningful and randomness can have precision.",1
 What we get are three-dimensional caves and two-dimensional characters.,0

" Darkly comic and even touching at times, Green Room is a solid horror movie that colors outside the genre lines.",1
" Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that's asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either.",0
" The Batman Begins of slasher movies, and one of the more frightening stabathons of recent years.",1
" It's no The Last Jedi, but it's fun, exciting, and quite entertaining, a combo that is made all the more impressive given the long, bumpy, and nearly-disastrous road that it took to finally come to the screen.",1

 A below-average superhero movie that suggests we don't necessarily need a superhero movie every summer.,0

 Heading Home is a film that will tell the legend of Team Israel for years to come.,1
 Two-thirds of a good movie.,1
" When the film leaves the realm of the impolite or even criminal for something far more extreme, it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful.",0
" The film is taken with comfy gags that celebrate these men's ownership of pop culture, filtering them through a lens of unrevealing caricature.",0
" One can imagine Franco and his buddies seeing The Bad Batch or watching Mad Max: Fury Road, renting some motor bikes and dirtying some clothes, and then realizing they forgot to write an actual movie.",0

" Although this comedy-drama seems to have been written specifically to give Meryl Streep a chance to dress up and put on a silly show, it's actually all true. ",1
" Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.",0

 This submarine flick has some tense moments and plenty of action.,1
 Identity Thief feels painfully misguided for nearly every one of its interminable 108 minutes.,0

 The story squanders its own fine setup.,1
" Greta gets people riled up, and that's entirely thanks to Isabelle Huppert's bonkers energy. She is feisty and fiery, playing her character with self-awareness and verve.",1
" Instead, it is a half-baked, superficial story, a prime example of straight white male hubris, trying and failing to masquerade as original and interesting, lacking... the humour or light-heartenedness that would make it entertaining.",0
 Streep just doesn't know how to sleepwalk through a role like this.,1
 It's like an expensive B-movie that makes a lot of noise but signifies absolutely nothing.,0

 W isn't a flawless classic but it certainly provokes thought about the rule of a president few will be sorry to see the back of.,1
" Haneke doesn't deign to deliver the genre goods-resolution, catharsis, etc. That way he can crudely spell out his themes and yet still give the bourgeois audience the finger.",0
" Like the first one, it's played for laughs in-between bouts of mayhem; most of the gags are off-target, though Mirren's Nancy Mitfordesque assassin gets a pretty good kill ratio.",0

" There are a couple of winks to icons of the genre (Scream, for example)... but the rest is the usual: running, screams and torrents of blood without rhyme or reason. [Full review in Spanish]",0

 The best that can be said about Straw Dogs is that it's watchable: and that's due to Alexander Skarsgard's stellar abs.,0

" Underworld: Awakening boasts some fun stylized action, and Kate Beckinsale back in that skin-tight outfit, but it also continues the franchise's streak of frustrating mediocrity.",0

 Dark and yet cinematically playful. ,1
" A dull, pretentious, and godly dreary pseudo-thriller...",0

" Fair to say, though, that Ghost's overwhelming visual achievements tend to dwarf any serious consideration of what it means to be human and an action-enhanced story. ",0
" Lost are Fellini's autobiographical nuances, the deep philosophical and psychoanalytical ramblings, the artistic construction of identity, and the very film specific deconstruction at play. They even scrap the circus! It just makes you wonder what the poi",0
 An intense if somewhat overwrought foray into South African street violence.,1
" But the last third is a disaster, everything that happens both asinine and illogical, and by the time it was over I could have cared less about any of the characters, their plight or if the killer was going to be stopped one smidgen of a single bit.",0

 It is hands down one of the best music documentaries ever made.,1
 ...the prevalence of the F-bomb does not add one thing to the story and only cheaply gives us any sort of gritty realism that quickly evaporates during the film's sequences on Elysium.,0
" Craig may not always get the details right, but her larger vision -- alternately pitiless and forgiving of teenage foibles in the midst of adolescence -- is still bracing. And the performances she encourages from her actors help pick up the slack.",1
" Even when Land of Mine charts a predictable path, it remains gripping from start to finish.",1
" It has this exploratory character that Shults showed in his first film, although, perhaps, the relationship with the background, with what he narrates, doesn't end with total cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]",1

" Ryan Coogler's film is very sad and will make you cry, and maybe that's a good thing. I acknowledge it's important to devote time and care to such portrayals of abuse and injustice, and Coogler has certainly done that.",1
" Its artfulness seems like an alibi, an excuse for keeping the ugliness of history out of the picture.",0
" If the idea of cozying up to Russia strikes you as harmless, or all those Syrian refugees are too far away to seem real, the HBO documentary Cries From Syria is something you ought to watch.",1
 Moments that hint at a psychedelic revelation to come never add up to much. Only in the last scene does the film seem to make good on the promise of its title.,0
" Lauren Cohan has real screen presence and looks capable of making the leap from TV to film, rarely an easy chasm to cross.",1
 What happened here?,0
" Ronan's big talent, the sweetness and resilience of the characters, and the film's big heart, are almost irresistible.",1

 The summer of inessential animation continues with this very middling sequel to 2014's semi-forgotten squirrel-based timekiller.,0

" It's the darkest of the six-film opus, but it just may be the best of the lot.",1
 Depp's one-joke performance makes the film a confection with a hollow center.,1
 The director (Leon Ichaso) and his co-writers haven't licked a crucial question: Why do we need to see this movie and not just listen to the music?,0
 Your tears may for how this glorified PSA embraces the smugness that Moore and Page's performances pointedly shun throughout. ,0

 Disney's depersonalizing habit of putting different teams in charge of different sections of the story really shows up here.,0
" Not quite as clever as it thinks it is, but it's still too clever for its own good.",0
" It is, however, a very endearing portrait of John and Amanda Leyden, the chain-smoking, wise-cracking educators who run Headfort, and whose proximity to retirement age lends the project a certain wistfulness.",1
 [The] dire warnings about the direction in which America is heading are most disturbing.,1
" Saul Dibb's foamy adaptation of Amanda Foreman's ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" focuses its soft soap attention so much on its leading lady's personal struggles that it all but leaves out the story's broiling 18th century political and social context",0
 Rooney Mara and Ben Mendelsohn wrestle with the slippery semantics of sexual abuse in this muscular film adaptation of David Harrower's acclaimed stage play Blackbird.,1
" Problem is, there's nary a hint of context, even with biographic essentials.",0
" Incredibles 2 is a solid outing from Pixar, but after fourteen years of waiting, it should more than live up to its title.",0
" Like all of the Farrellys' previous movies, Stuck on You suffers from an episodic script and an overly long running time plagued by too many dull, laugh-free patches.",0
 The film is poorly written and directed at the most basic levels.,0
 Postpones the inevitable conclusion long enough to tell a good story,1
 One of the best animated movies from a vintage year.,1
" The film is an often thought-provoking metaphor. But as a thriller, it becomes dreary.",0
" The best father-son story in all of Hollywood animation, and maybe animation generally...exploits the potential of computer animation like no film before it and few films after it.",1
 Too quickly the random fights pile up -- so many yakuza thugs who forgot to wear chain mail that morning -- and you yearn for the film that might have been.,0
" In the process of avoiding a feature-length replay of the TV show (a trap The Honeymooners walked right into), Bewitched edifies die-hard fans by channeling the original's memorable supporting cast.",1
" Troubling news from the future: we'll perfect robotics, but still be unable to master a decent toupee.",0
" Some things work well, but many are strained in execution. There are times Nacho Libre looks like it's struggling to find a reason to continue.",0
" The over-the-top destruction that follows seems all out of proportion to the misdeed, but then logic isn't the purpose of a film like this.",0
 Epitaph it's a movie that had everything to be something interesting but ends up being a boring story with beautiful snowy landscapes. [Full review in Spanish],0
 Yawn of the Dead.,0
" Look, if you turn off your brain and just let the succession of images wash over you, the film can be dumb fun, just don't go looking for anything remotely resembling comprehensibility. That apparently does not exist in the Predator universe.",0
" Blade of the Immortal lacks depth as a quest for redemption narrative, but makes for good (and very bloody) pulpy fun in Miike's skillful hands.",1
" An ambitious (if somewhat uneven) slice of downbeat American gothic which interweaves grim melancholia with pointed satire, doomy portent and moments of gnawing revulsion.",1
" None of this is earthshaking, but Prince Caspian is a largely satisfying experience -- not too serious and not too silly with just the right 'wow' factor.",1
 Tedeschi combines the raw sensuality of an Anna Magnani with the melancholic introspection of a Monica Vitti and is well worth discovering.,1
" You find yourself happy that this film exists, but wishing it were better.",1
" An impressively passionate recreation of a now-distant era. Above all it is a triumph for Doupe, who scraps and bawls and triumphs like a star from the golden age.",1
 Zombie's moody shocker finds the part-time singer still floundering to find his voice as a filmmaker while offering clear-cut evidence that it takes more than a deep love of the horror genre to become a great horror director.,0
" The experience of this film is beyond mixed, practically schizophrenic - long stretches of portentous, syrupy emptiness, followed by scenes that rank with Jenkins' best work in ""Moonlight"" and ""Medicine for Melancholy.""",0
" Assuredly, and productively, a project made from the modern persona of Nye.",1
 Treatment like this makes people shrug off reality rather than process it.,0
 A brutal -- and occasionally funny -- look at what it's like to live with an addiction that's treated with disdain.,1
 Sally Hawkins brings a combination of frailty and strength to her part in this movie that makes her performance the pillar on which everything else stands.,1
" David Frankel's film reduces an extraordinary life to a predictable template of bullying, resolve, success, disappointment, and platitudes - a pattern repeated two or three times until the genuinely moving finale.",0
" In a medium where the important decisions are almost always dictated by commerce rather than art, Brokeback Mountain is as close to perfection as we are likely to get.",1
" A fun, fast-paced adventure, chockablock with gadgets and action yet populated by characters we care about.",1
" Evans has a feel for mood, but it'd be wrong to mistake atmosphere for psychological depth; Kelly + Victor could've been so much more than what it ultimately achieves.",0
" It has no idea what kind of movie it wants to be. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, an action movie, a drama...it's just depressing. ",0
" Even if you don't enjoy the music, it will be hard not to come away from this celebratory work without admiration for a woman who keeps climbing back, a creative force to be reckoned with.",1

 Crash mercilessly apes Magnolia.,0
 Close doesn't need to say anything for us to understand that something is brewing within her. That's good acting.,1
 It's a flawed and sometimes deceptively-scripted affair.,0
" In Cuaron's hands, the world of Harry Potter doesn't feel like a synthetic movie theme park anymore. It's almost real, Hogwarts and all.",1
" Considering the best thing here is a joke about Billy Crystal letting his freak flag fly, it's painfully apparent there's just no rehabilitating this stinker.",0
" This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem.",1
" The 33 lacks in emotion, construction and staging. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
" The material is beyond stale, but it's made significantly fresher by Robinson and a very enthusiastic cast. ",0
 Their marriage seems real but their predicament feels like no more than a scriptwriter's invention.,0
 I can't recommend this to anyone other than hardcore extraterrestrial junkies.,0
 Nothing to see here. Except tentacles. Lots and lots of tentacles.,0
" Jenison's obsession is the basis for a playful,entertaining film. I wasn't convinced for a millisecond by his wackadoodle theory, but I enjoyed every minute of Tim's Vermeer. ",1
" The result isn't seven years long, but you'll feel every minute of its two hours.",0
 Carter comes off as compassionate and intelligent. But the complex issues brought up in his book don't get much more than a superficial debate.,0
" There are some funny moments, but it's quite obvious that no one associated with this movie knows anything about rap music.",0
" For fans wondering if you should see the much-touted documentary memorial concert film Michael Jackson's This Is It, rest assured, the late King of Pop delivers.",1
" There's a lot of laughter, suspense and fun as the film asks the viewer to suspend belief on a most entertaining trip you won't soon forget.",1
" In short, this film could have used a Rise of the Planet of the Apes treatment.",0
" Though it fails to do justice to Matheson's novel, /I Am Legend/ isn't without merit, particularly in its stately, moody build-up. Unfortunately, the final act squanders the tension in favour of daft religious symbolism and silly CG zombies. Shame.",1
" If you ever wanted a movie to put in the time capsule so future generations can puzzle over the bankruptcy of our current kiddie culture, Bratz is it.",0
" The unfortunate disconnect between great artistry and great commercial success runs throughout history. But Bernstein is a special case because, unlike so many great musicians who fell unwillingly by the wayside, he chose his own path.",1
" ... a charismatic, warm and positive lesson about friendship, family ties and the search for personal acceptance. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Kravitz and Kirke perform well, but John Cho seems underused in his role and his character could have had the potential to generate more tension as the cops close in. Worth a watch though.",1
" The Woman in Black feels like a simpler and more intimate horror of yesteryear.It's well produced, acted and written and for fans of vintage horror, you'll definitely be entertained.",1
" A stirring exploration of the overwhelming desire for motherhood, the whims of fate, clashing cultures and what happens when exporting children becomes part of a country's economy.",1
 It's like the childhood dream of the president of the National Rifle Association.,0
" In the Loop is political satire at its best, leaving you giggling at the one-liners yet feeling complete despair about the political process.",1
" Blended throws a lot of things on the screen, but in the end, it has to confront its awkward and artificial ""romance."" And that's just ugly.",0
" Results is not without nice touches, and will raise a sm ile more than a few times. Guy Pearce's slightly off-kilter performance as philosophy-driven Trevor is worth a look.",1
" If the Rangers are on the CW, Banks is in a universe of her own, stalking about the small town of Angel Grove in hobo dominatrix gear, dramatically stage whispering, ""GOLD,"" ""CRYSTALS"" and ""KRISPY KREME"" to no one in particular.",0
" Ford gives one of his most commanding performances outside of a Lucas production, establishing an action formula Ford would repeat...[Blu-Ray]",1
" Flynn, who looks like a younger version of the young Christian Slater, is skinny, intense, a bit wary. If you've ever been the parent of a male adolescent - if you've ever been a male adolescent - you'll recognize him.",1
" The mix of wonky physics, mysticism, and genetically modified corn is so clunky it's ... fabulous.",1
" if you go to this movie and find any decent laugh in there whatsoever, you should know right now that I have nothing but utter contempt for you.",0
" I couldn't buy that two supposedly sophisticated theater people could be so simpleminded about what defines comedy and tragedy. I also couldn't believe in most of the characters, including either version of Melinda.",0
 Action fantasy based on Chinese myths falls short. ,0
" An unfunny, unromantic attempt at a sex comedy with some of the most boring bedroom scenes ever filmed.",0
" Since crafting a potently polarising masterpiece with 2011's The Tree Of Life, Malick has become a man on a mission. A mission to stuff a movie so full of coded self-indulgence it seems like a perverse joke that has misplaced its own punchline.",0
" With its bare-bones plot, lackluster characters and foolish adherence to slasher tropes, Leprechaun Returns is a film that should have been left at the bottom of the well.",0
" The film's two romances are implausible, the dialogue is drawn out with geriatric pauses and the constant funk soundtrack does little to make sense of a plot more disjointed than Brian Cox's knees.",0
" This movie is so bland, I can't even bring myself to completely trash it with a one-star spike.",0
" Kemp makes a virtue of his choppy cuts and fantasy segments, although the film does take a little while to settle into a rhythm and one or two of the earlier girlfriends feel less fleshed out than others.",1
" ""It?s like trying to make a football movie set in the 1970s about this plucky little underdog team called the Dallas Cowboys.""",0
 It's not deep: it's a wispy-light meringue of a romantic spy-versus-spy comedy. But it is smart. It expects that you're keeping up with the tricks it's trying to pull on you.,1
 Charlie Lyne's debut feature is a dizzying and dedicated essay on the previously unheralded genre of teen movies.,1
" ""Sully"" offers a large-scale air near-disaster, but the real draw here is the star turn, with Hanks shaping an interior life to Sully that's as powerful as any plane crash imagery.",1
" Whimsical, entrancing and ephemeral, it should airily appeal to those who loved 'Midnight in Paris' (2011).",1
" Perfeclty tense atmosphere and performances, with the sparks flying between Bogart and Bacall.",1
" Pat and silly, the movie offers a wheezy moral that a buttoned-up American just needs a sensitive Latino and some ethnic cuisine to end the blues.",0
" The film is repetitive, top-heavy: Wright blows his wad too early. But a different lead might have kept you laughing and engaged.",0
" At times it feels like we're watching the birth pains of a new strain of queer cinema, one both beautiful and tragic, unapologetic and glorious.",1
" Just a generic thriller, the kind of movie that won't even be remembered -- let alone win an award -- come Oscar time.",0
" The movie's motives might be admirable, but its execution is so bogged down in impenetrable old-white-guy self-pity that the real problems facing public education and its practitioners get buried in the wallow.",0
" Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't playing in 3-D in every theater, but that's the only way to see it. Even then you have to wait until the last half-hour for the good stuff.",0
" If you didn't know this was a fake film, you could easily believe it's real.",1
 [The Dark Tower]...would have been better off as a mini-series rather than starting a film franchise that serves as a rebooted sequel to the books.,0
 Friedkin Uncut is an entertaining portrait of a versatile filmmaker that changed a generation.,1
" The tone of this droll, thrillingly odd animated film isn't easy to describe...A tad dark for little kids, this one-of-a-kind movie delivers 80 minutes of idiosyncratic inspiration.",1

 The Darkest Minds is the latest Hunger Games knock-off to get the big screen treatment - and the latest to offer another clunky and melodramatically rendered dystopian future where adolescents are maltreated by adults who fear them.,0
" An extraordinary story receives a decidedly ordinary treatment in this worthy weepie, which can't get either Ford or Fraser to catch fire. Heartstrings get tugged and tear-ducts tickled, but it's more Lifetime movie than movie of a lifetime.",0
 Granik's star-making instincts are as sharp as ever. ,1
" ... is lively, cunning and witty. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" ... a tame CGI cartoon for the simple-minded: the very young, the very old and Yankee fans.",0
 It's rare to see a movie fail in every possible area ...,0
" Like the original film, except its themes more directly address real-life bias in the workplace by giving its female protagonist the permission to be cutthroat, self-obsessed, sexual, and completely unapologetic - and we still want to root for her.",1
" It's Sarah Polley through and through: slightly too glum for its own good, but reeking of quality and feeling.",1
 ...ultimately suffers from a middling midsection that's been suffused with pointless digressions and melodramatic crises...,0
 Most of the gags were juvenile.,0
 A touching and insightful black comedy that gracefully spans sixty years.,1
" A sweetly spoofy, thoughtful animated feature, sure to please its preteen target audience.",1
" Jenkins's spare, frank lyricism foregrounds the couple's tense discussions about the traumas of history, the weight of cultural memory, and the pressure of racial injustice; he lends the intimate tale a vast and vital resonance.",1
" This beautifully designed, cherry blossom-hued cartoon is brighter, breezier and bouncier than most.",1
" A well-needed break from genocide-clicking titans, this breezy sequel is adequately entertaining, but vastly forgettable.",0
" The big question here is why any of ""The Voices,"" as crisply made and stylish as it is, should matter or entertain. The cold truth is that it doesn't.",0
" It's certainly all Araki up there, and the film is handsome and swiftly paced. But it also feels terribly routine and even, strangely, for all the trangressiveness it strives for, retrograde.",0
 A surprisingly delightful little treat. ,1
" The humor magnifies the horror, and vice versa. Like the inflammatory Dr. Strangelove, we've sewn these seeds, and we deserve whatever is reaped from them.",1
 The backstage stuff becomes monotonous and ruins the film.,0
" While [it] is a mixed bag, it's a fun, occasionally raucously funny satire...",1

" In trying to please international tastes, this movie doesn't have much personality of its own.",0
" Minor Haynes is still an interesting curio, particularly given the stylistic acumen on display, but it's easily his least effective film thus far.",0
" Raazi is an excellent film because of how easily it could have not been one. On another day, this might have well been a jingoistic Neeraj Pandey actioner called Naam Sehmat. ",1
 The only thing funny about this movie is how numbingly unfunny an hour and a half can be.,0
 Emma Thompson is a treat as the eponymous childminder.,1
" Both the performances and the dialogue in this film are incredibly stilted, further compounding the sheer boredom that takes hold in the second half.",0

 I couldn't help but think if Shyamalan wouldn't have had a better movie if he'd stuck with former star Willis,1
 A romantic comedy full of poorly executed cliches of the genre. [Full review in Spanish] ,0

 It's a credit to the animators that they were able to create believable emotions in these beeping hunks of computer-generated metal.,1

 An exhilarating black-and-white New York seriocomedy from Noah Baumbach with a stellar star turn by co-writer Greta Gerwig.,1
 Unsatisfying and more than a little dull.,0
 The movie is both a star vehicle and an ensemble piece; the other actors revolve around Newman yet give off more than just his reflected light.,1
" With gorgeous cinematography and an exceptional cast, including a breakout performance from Josh Wiggins, Hellion allows its audience to travel the downward spiral of a broken family and is absolutely gripping thanks to its authentic feel.",1
 There's no style and no substance in a remake destined to be nothing more than a guilty pleasure for some. [Full review in Spanish],0
" Every year the DVD will [be] displayed as though it's worthy of renting. But it's out because it takes place around the holidays, not because it belongs to be there.",0

" Severely wasting the talents of Rosemary DeWitt, who really, really deserves better material, Arizona is as arid and barren as the state that provides its title.",0
" Its plot, updated from Fugard's 1950s settings, reduces moral issues to pointlessly simplistic levels. Using a baby to redeem a criminal is neither realistic nor honest, especially as it's enacted here.",0

 Dark and too often tedious. ,0
 The movie is laugh -out-loud funny and surprisingly touching.,1
 This reboot is a spirited effort that ends up a pale specter of the original in the end.,0
" Duigan has the makings of a good yarn, but instead of trusting the story and his characters, he becomes fatally bogged down in trying to make statements.",0
" Tony Scott's loose remake of Sargent's 1974 film is mixed blessing: Helgeland's characterizations are deeper and sharper, but the film suffers from excessive stylistic flourishes and preposterous last reel.",0

" The mishmash that results is by turns creepy, silly, inventive, darkly funny and, at one point, mind-blowingly bloody.",1
 Everything we learned in the previous films collides with timelines and character histories that keep altering before our eyes. It's no time at all before the characters are as lost as the audience.,0
" 20th Century Women will likely mean more to anyone old enough to have experienced the '70s, but the movie's big draw is Bening.",1
" Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him.",0
" Watching his movie, we feel distinctly the absence of a safety net -- anything can happen. Which will drive some audiences crazy, but which delighted me.",1
" In the main, Malick's juxtaposition of the ebb and flow of the natural world against the microcosm of family life is extremely effective and deeply affecting.",1
" Home foreclosure meets hooker hell in The Client List, yet another entry into that ever expanding genre of recession blues cinema. While Cybill Shepherd doing Mae West with a string of raunchy one-liners, just about steals the show from Hewitt.",1
" 107 minutes of witless nonsense, populated by performers who would look more at home in after-school specials, and filmmakers who ought to have been left stranded on the unemployment line.",0
" Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family.",1
" It ain't easy being green, especially as the charmless CG stars of this lowest-common-denominator action-comedy.",0
" As much as it is invigorating visually and moving emotionally, the film does turn at last on this familiar device, the damaged white man in need of spiritual and ideological fixing.",1
" An unimaginative biopic , which follows the standard timeline of his career so straightforwardly that the screenplay is practically adapted directly from Tupac's Wikipedia page ",0
" While ""Monsieur Lazhar"" is a decent film, I wish it would have done more to stand out from other similar films.",1
" The film is so velvety textured and dreamy, I would've stuck around for more. That is Cianfrance's special talent.",1

" ""Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?"" Amelia asks in a voice-over. And you want to shout, ""This movie does, honey."" There's not a real or spontaneous minute in it.",0
 Fails to convey the influential reach of the photographers' work and shows disinterest in engaging with the charges of exploitation and complicity leveled at them.,0
 The result feels less like a thoughtfully-conceived franchise-starter than a picture that was rushed out of the editing suite prematurely.,0
 Loses by a few touchdowns.,0
" Meant to cash in on the craze for fantasy films about hormonal teens started by a certain chick-lit vampire series, Beastly merely shows how Twilight got it right.",0
" Full of shaggy self-deprecation and wistful romantic realization, Sleepwalk with Me is an amiable tale of beta-male discovery.",1
" The Iron Giant captures and crystallizes its source material's anxious, humane spirit. It might be the most empathetic and exhilarating mainstream American animated feature ever made.",1
" There's nothing snarky or air quote-ish about the story, but there is a recognition that this is a superhero the size of a grain of rice. In this case, that's super enough.",1
 Comes off like a series of forgettable History Channel recreations with some axeman versus vampire video game scenes tossed in. Editing is choppy; some transitions are sloppy. A parchment paper-thin conceit playing at being a feature-length movie.,0
 [A] high-gloss thriller... which is undeniably entertaining yet whose pleasures have the guilty edge of a particularly lurid airport read.,1

 [Farrier] leaves what's most interesting about the underground fetish in Tickled untouched.,0
 A lacerating portrait of an emotionally empty hairdresser and the multitudinous female company he keeps.,1

 This film is neither controversial nor interesting enough to warrant much attention either way.,0
" For all the film's political chutzpah and savvy filtering of contemporary issues through sci-fi allegory, In Time is a pretty dopey movie.",1
" ""The Fits"" is unlike any dance film you'll ever see, which doesn't automatically make it good, just different. The film suffers from being diminutively compelling throughout, regardless of how deeply under your skin the score gets. ",1
" I don't want to watch Muppets modeling responsible communication or having a Defining the Relationship talk, but also, I don't want to watch Kermit the Frog stringing along a pig who's worth five of him.",0
 [A] film of sentimental perceptivity delivered by some of the most amiable and charismatic actors working today. Sad then that it is not a great film thanks to a series of critical miscalculations by its acclaimed writer/director.,0
 Not much seems to have changed in the world of urban heterosexuals since Hal Salwen's 1995 techno-prophetic classic Denise Calls Up.,1
" It's a light-hearted film that is smarter than it seems-or as Wain once said, ""a deliberately terrible romantic comedy.""",1
 A none-too-winning blend of the unsettling and the unsurprising.,0
" All a rather predictable outcome that doesn't offer anything we've not seen before, but Anthony Hopkins saves it.",1

 An urgent look at the fall of Versailles,1
 It's a sweet movie...one of the best things about the movie is that it looks incredible.,1
" All setup and no payoff, it serves mainly as logistical scaffolding to reposition the characters and strum up some backstory, stalling for time before the final chapter.",0
 An intermittently amusing and muddled retelling of the beginnings of the Iran-contra affair.,1
" Linklater brings a shambling, easygoing charm to this unlikely comedy based on a real-life Texas murder case...and Jack Black, of all people, drolly essays the title character.",1
" Swofford has said he doesn't mind the movie's alterations, but the real issue is how it dulls the intimacy and idiosyncrasy of his voice, which was the book's compass.",1
" The formula is basically the same: 2.5 hour runtime, awful script, dislikable protagonist and at least an hour of robot-based carnage.",0
" The performance by Plummer, now in his mid-80s, amounts to a masterclass on how to use one's actual physical limitations to advantage.",1
 Jennifer Lawrence is superb in Debra Granik's graceful film about gritty people.,1

 Wild Honey Pie is one you can pass on and spend your time doing better things... like poking at your eye with a toothpick.,0

 Riveting performance from James Franco dominates as iconic Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg does battle with intrusive animation and static talking-head scenes. There's no rhyme nor reason for this ill-conceived concept.,0
 The bottom line here is don't let this Intruder into your house.,0
" One wishes the best for her career, but the movie about her seems more interested in her as a curiosity.",0
" A startlingly good exploration of good, evil and the perseverance of love.",1
 Ant-Man symbolises American accomplishment. It is about people transcending the physical limitations of the human body and it is also a comedy variation on the political idea that the smallest person can change the world.,0
" Sully won't just please crowds and evoke tears but, in an angry, ugly time in our national history, it should also resonate deeply with many.",1
 The screenplay essentially turns Shirley into a black man who thematically shapeshifts into whoever will make the story appealing to white audiences - and that's inexcusable.,0

" It's like discovering a new formula to reach a similar result. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slightly darker in tone and less campy than the ""Spider-Man"" films. Visually stunning, emotional, and intelligent; ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" lives up to its name. ",1
" In the end, one's reaction to Burton's blockbuster is little more than that of the Joker to Batman: 'Where did he get those wonderful toys?'",0

" Kaminski is content to play mental games with an occasional fright, confusing ambiguity with fear.",0
" Long before the end, it's an old-fashioned high tech army fighting the Mimics, who are as spirited and pretty as Blunt. The combat is endless and predictable.",0
" Oh, to have my brain wiped of Push. The smell of desperation on the part of filmmakers to create their own superhero franchise is rancid.",0
" Somewhere in that mess is a film, possibly a good one. As presented, however, Suicide Squad is a wasted opportunity.",0
" Looking back for a suitably rousing episode from our national past, Curtis has alighted on Dunkirk, a tragedy narrowly averted, which he reprises as mirthless, feelgood farce.",0
" Like many South Korean films, revenge is a major theme here, although the way Kim handles it is particularly subtle and surprising: It sneaks up on you. ",1

 Gringo is a Coen Brothers movie for when you don't want to be bothered with the moral weight of an actual Coen Brothers movie.,1
" What Johnson does best, probably better than anyone else right now, is to draw attention to the absurdity, even the impossibility of himself. In a movie so invested on making him seem possible, that performance, so endearing and so smart, gets lost.",0

 This is a very accomplished movie.,1
 Two disparate films for the price of one.,0

" With rich irony, The World juxtaposes the teasing, grand images of the outside world's wonders with the insular community and the mundane lives of the park employees.",1
" Amazingly, this is Ryan's first lead role in a feature film, and although the sparse Abundant Acreage doesn't always rise to her level, her understated but powerful performance brings the story to life - even in the dead of winter.",1
" With all of its technical virtuosity, The Revenant nevertheless has little soul. DiCaprio's performance is a tortured master class in method re-acting, but all of the prolonged suffering turns gratuitous.",0
" The big thrills and few laughs are no match for the cumbersome, convoluted story, not to mention the nonexistent chemistry between Cruise and Wallis.",0
 It's largely director Elijah Bynum's casting that makes this movie.,1

 Ultimatum tries to stir sympathy for its indestructible hero. But Jason Bourne has all the charm of a howitzer. He needs some time with the Harry Potter bunch.,0
" With a title like 'Dog Days', it is clear that you're not going to be watching Citizen Kane. Really, the film does what it says on the tin-there are a lot of cute dogs, some cheesy dialogue, and sweet relationships. ",1
 The Hurt Locker is a frequently gripping film that contains some terrifically detailed sequences; not only depicting the process of defusing bombs but also depicting just how complex the act of targeting and firing a gun can be.,1
" This film confirmed Disney's suspicion that conventional animation is dead, but audiences will flock to any digitally animated film, even an inferior one like 'Chicken Little.'",0
" It's dark and gritty and even a little tawdry, pushing ... deep into Death Wish territory, which is exactly as it should be.",1

" Ready Player One is a love letter to '80s pop culture, jam packed with references... Beneath its retro glad rags, however, the story is deceptively layered.",1
" Sour, substandard fare, a murky melodrama that fails on almost every level except stylish production design.",0
" ""Scream 4"" is a strange concoction, clever and self-knowing in the extreme and yet operating in primal ways that bypass wit. Something about it feels very modern.",1

 Bridge Of Spies is a clear example of a politically correct film with impecable production values that takes no risks. [Full review in Spanish],1

" After meandering around for more than an hour, the film snaps electrically into focus for the pivotal scene",0
" A bland, awkward, occasionally amusing comedy",0
" Although the film is relatively faithful to the plot of the book ... missteps in casting, tone, structure and editing leave Horns a barely functional mess of a film.",0

 An entirely predictable script that chugs along to the foregone loser-beats-odds conclusion.,0
" Even the extra-loud crazies who were sitting a few rows behind me cheered for the characters. You know a horror flick has done its job when the audience is rooting for the characters versus yelling at the screen, 'Just kill 'em off!'",1
 This is a war movie that is dressed up like a sci-fi film to sneak in a message about Iraq and Afghanistan.,0
" Bland, over-stuffed, chaotic and ultimately underwhelming for both kids and adults.",0

" One of the best things in the movie is a conversation between Pitt and Jenkins, on a torrential day, seated in a nondescript car beneath a bridge.",1
 The movie is filmed in a way that makes it seem like the camera has epilepsy and the color desaturation renders everything murky. Someone should remind director Marcus Nispel that there's a difference between making a music video and a feature film.,0

" Just like in ""Garden State,"" Braff takes all of the trials and tribulations of Bloom family life and ties it all off in a happily-ever-after finale. ""Wish I Was Here"" is light entertainment but forces itself upon you.",0
 An exceedingly dull and stillborn attempt to update the Brothers Grimm.,0
 Too watered down for adults - lacking the satiric bite you might expect from a tale narrated by Death - and too grim and dull for kids. ,0
 There's a whiff of pointlessness hanging over this whole affair. The fact that Valkyrie is not the thriller the trailer promises is treason against the talent.,0
" It's another kinda, sorta based on a true story, inspirational sports film in the vein of any given Bruckheimer sports film.",0
 This exuberantly vulgar coming-of-age story is more exhausting than exhilarating.,0

 A cursory farewell to a franchise that deserved better.,0

" Mars is a fireball of failure, a B-movie crammed full of A-list actors, an exercise in tacky self-indulgence that will numb you with its labored eccentricities. What's more, it would take a greater detective than I to find a single funny line.",0
" If you've given up on the many iterations of the Bond franchise, it's worth shaking off all that adaptation decay and going back to the original, which is more fun and less sexist than many of the later films. ",1

 If all you wanted was a movie that fetishizes the tools of the Transporter's trade - read: vehicles and violence - then you'll have no problem with this revival,0
" Despite its lively origins as a graphic novel, the film is hopelessly dull.",0

 The Revenant is intensely disturbing and brutally mesmerizing with exquisite imagery and a beautifully bleak atmosphere. ,1
" A powerful, thoughtful and moving work of science-fiction that engages the head and the heart.",1
" An altogether astonishing film, not in the least because Winter's Bone lives up to the hype -- or so nearly that it makes no difference.",1
 Toy-based superhero action movie is forgettable. ,0
" The splattery violence, which reduces humanity to meat and reproduction to a survival instinct, enacts a blunt rebuttal to the idea that science and art -- 'Ozymandias' and even John Denver are referenced -- offer humankind an opportunity for immorality.",1
" The excellent performances power the movie along, and when it hits the mark, Thoroughbreds is superb.",1
" If you can dig that kind of hilarious idiocy (and I know I can), then you're just the audience for this.",1
" Furious 6 is even cooler and more aerodynamically delirious than its predecessor, if such a thing is even theoretically possible.",1
" ""Tammy,"" when it's not getting slapstick laughs, seems not to know what kind of movie it is.",0
" The original has been built up to classic scale, but Carpenter's remake is actually far scarier and equally thoughtful.",1
 When this film works... it works! It does a skillful job capturing the mindset of a teenager coming to grips with his sexuality.,1

 This is just filling - something to hold over hungry movie-goers - until the next Avengers movie drops next year.,0
 You could put Garner in a Taken/John Wick-style high-concept action-thriller annually and I'd show up for each and every one of them.,1

" The film gets credit for heart, and a certain amount of rock 'n' roll spirit, but that's about it.",0
" Whether in the past or the present, Jane Goodall has never looked better.",1
" A wild, wooly strut through a period in American history when the country rallied around a man who would probably, at the end of the broadcast, be lying unconscious at the end of the runway, ready to get up and do it again the very next night.",1
" El Royale may try your patience, though I loved the slow-burn, multi-faceted lead-up to its violent finale... Goddard is an old hand at juggling tropes and character, action and feeling.",1
 An often oppressively by-the-numbers comedy...,0
 The film's cast is as game as ever to bring the story to life and the special effects continue to amaze,1
" I am giving Gigli one star and that is only because of Walken: if Brest were smart, when the film hits DVD, he should only release that scene and stick the rest in the deleted scenes section.",0
 A fun from the start of the first note of a song to the last. [Full review in Spanish],1
" An adaptation with grace, ease and, everything is said, in the most obvious way imaginable. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" Bravely weird, it shows sex and violence exploding, without explanation or definition, at a time when people felt out of control, simultaneously seduced and menaced. These complications make it a troubling, unforgettable experience.",1
" Perhaps the best that can be said of ""Free Birds"" is that it makes the turkey the hero of Thanksgiving once again. It's just too bad that the film is written as though viewers have only bird brains.",0
" A highly enjoyable, breezy action film. Cruise and Diaz are fun to watch.",1
" If only Roberts' warmth, coupled with Javier Bardem's scruffy sexiness as Felipe, were enough to compensate for the folded-map flatness of this production.",0
" The movie is set up as a quirky romance between two lost souls, but in the end it seems more like a stalemate than a love match.",0
" The second half is better than the first half, but this isn't remotely the sprawling epic that fans arguably deserved. ",1
" A competent, uncontroversial, rather shouty version of a play which is now safely canonical and, if the philistinism may be forgiven, less remarkable than it once seemed, when dramas of the liberal conscience had an urgent edge.",0
" The Purge offers a unique take on the home invasion sub-genre which makes for an entertaining watch thanks to a strong finish, despite sporting poor horror logic.",1
 The mix of groin injury and over-explanation could totally reach 9-year-olds and a greying Atkinson is still relentlessly lovable.,1
" Is there now enough evidence to support the idea that [The Matrix's] pop brilliance, its kinetic-yet-smartly-allegorical storytelling, was an anomaly?",0
" There's a depressing irony to the fact that The Hunger Games, a book series about the media's ability to placate the masses with superficial distractions, is now a mainstream film franchise that has spawned its own cult of celebrity.",0
 The referee should have cried 'foul' on this long before it hit the screens.,0
" ''Django Unchained'' is Tarantino at his most puerile and least inventive, the premise offering little more than cold, nasty revenge and barrels of squishing, squirting blood.",0
 An effective and ghoulish horror film which takes the viewer on a nightmarish journey into the tortured soul of a serial killer and the secret society's demonic purpose that spawned him.,1
" The Look of Silence is a breathtaking, haunting piece of documentary cinema, one whose existence is truly baffling and whose images will linger for untold years to come.",1
" Features a strong performance by Sally Hawkins, but not much else.",0
" It isn't too great a chore to sit though this film, but it isn't really compelling, either. The story lacks a real payoff punch.",0
" ""Iron Man""'s true revelation is leading man Robert Downey, Jr., who may not be giving the greatest superhero performance ever, but is certainly the best actor to ever portray a superhero.",1
" While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it's based upon, Queen Of The Damned is a pointless, meandering celebration of the goth-vampire, tortured woe-is-me lifestyle.",0
" Formerly a real American hero, G.I. Joe is no longer a hero (it's a team) or American (it's a multinational unit of military superstars, though the way they do business you'd rather have the Croatian navy on your side). As for real, well...",0
" Despite the visual splendor, this 3D spectacle lacks any depth.",0
" A film that benefits from Ms. Moore's lovely performance, yet suffers from glib contrivance and predictable writing.",1
" This near-end-of-the-world movie for teenagers, set mostly in the English countryside, is too vague and shaky for its own good, but it generates a haunting ambiance and develops a cumulative power.",1
" what begins as an atmospheric mystery ends disappointingly as a connect-the-dots action piece, far too drearily literal to be all in someone's head.",0
" Lust, Caution is a disappointment coming from director Ang Lee, but it's a watchable one, and it rattles around in your head for a long time after you've seen it, as much for what it does right as for where it goes wrong.",0
" A timeless portrait of two individuals' awkward, euphoric first encounter with love.",1
" With its bold premise, it's designed to provoke discussion, and should make a greater impact in homes than on the big screen. ",1
 Animated tale mixes mild scariness with Hawaiian lore. ,1
 That the picture walks and sometimes crosses the line into the products it parodies is a measure of its zealous thoroughness and also its central pitfall.,1
 A movie made ONLY for fans of the Divergent series. [Full review in Spanish],0
 [A] real pleasure in its laid-back way.,1
 Close's craft raises the saddest of stories to the level of art.,1
" Can The Hunger Games, in the movie version directed by Gary Ross, successfully navigate the crossing from page to screen? Our answer: Eh.",0
 the kind of spectacular edge-of-your-seat epic that will have you hooked right from its jaw-dropping opening sequence and dare you to resist the urge to applaud when it's finished.,1
" There is just too much that is too silly about Goldeneye and too many mistakes in the making. It is not as actively stupid as some Bond films have been, but it is well below average in intelligence for the already not too cerebral series.",0
" Despite being only 84 minutes, it seemed overlong and padded.",0
" Staying true to the documentary form, Dorsey employs a sense of drama, depth, and pathos to remind us that redemption, and even glory, come with a price, as do moral compromise and management's inevitable ability to have its way.",1
" it's successful at giving its audience the feeling that they have shared an experience with these characters for almost ten years, and that their farewell is bittersweet.",1
 Sputters in and spins its wheels in an idiotic waste of time.,0
 Excellent romantic comedy except for the Bridget Fonda/Matt Dillon resolution. HE DOESN'T DESERVE HER!!!,1
" Arch and pretty dull, with a certain sour undertone. And it just isn't very funny.",0
" Kick Ass is about as exciting as movies get. Not just because it is a (mostly) anarchic splatter-fest that celebrates (nay, encourages) acts of ridiculous violence, but also the fact that it was made completely outside of the studio system.",1
" Underneath its comical surface lies a story about responsibility, parenting and a troubling history of neglect. With Housebound Johnstone asks his audience not to look the other way in the most intriguing and riotous way possible.",1
" This is not that film. It's an intimate, small-scale portrait of how a profoundly unintelligent policy impacted one family.",1
" By miscalculation, accident or madness (not to mention badness), mankind, or much of it, could evaporate in a nuclear cloud ... the film grabs our attention",1
" Second Act has nothing to recommend it, even as a temporary refuge from traffic gridlock.",0
" Mr. Gibson is good enough to give the film substance, making ""Forever Young"" far easier to sit through than it has any right to be.",1
 Disappointing effort that relies on slapstick and other cliches of the genre. And it goes on way too long.,0
" Passione"" succeeds at being as entertaining as its subject matter, replicating the ""avalanche"" of sound.",1
" True to his temperament, Kaurismaki has made another funny-sad movie about the tenuousness of life, in all its ambiguity and nonsensical symmetry.",1
" The nefarious company he works for has etched a bar code tattoo on the back of his bald head, making him as easy to track as a tomato at Dominick's.",0
 What's refreshing is that the use of CGI is minimal but well utilized.,1
" Unfortunately, by the end of it, Capote isn't the only one who wants to turn to drink.",0
 The most overtly ideological moment comes when pot-smoking proves the boys' best weapon against evil.,0
 Paul Weitz's film is a seriously unfunny comedy about that intersection where politics meets entertainment.,0
" It's an ambitious, often arresting film, but it lacks cohesion, and the seesawing plot and motivations seem more indecisive than mysterious. Still, it's a promising debut ...",1
" Bland and testing, Adrift takes a tragic, compelling true-life story and makes it simply boring.",0
 The Night Before is comfortable existing in the grey area of holiday fare between the crude and the overly sappy.,1
" There was not one moment in Iron Man 2 where I didn't think ""I'm enjoying this""",1
" The film's emotional core and the story line is actually well written -- for a dumb comedy, at least.",1
" It's a humane and witty treatment of an average life that, incidentally, speaks to the worth and inherent drama of average lives.",1
" Riotously surreal and willfully so, it showcases Dwayne Johnson's star power, not to mention his pecs",1
" Terrificly acted, staged and designed, Gone WIth the Wind remains one of the greatest period epics ever filmed.",1
 This likable indie comedy fails to completely get off the ground.,0
 Every once in awhile real emotions peep through all the detached humor and it's a gut punch every time it happens.,1
" What's inevitably lost is any real attempt to track Liz's internal shifts, the way her travels jostle her preconceived notions of selfhood and spirituality.",1
" 'Lame!' would be a better title for this utterly unmemorable remake of Alan Parker's edgier, darker, remarkably fresh 1980 multi-Oscar-winner.",0
" It's a good thing the dogs are as adorable as they are, because there's not much going on around them.",0
" As fascinating as it is to have all of these interesting concepts and philosophies explored so thoroughly in a genre movie, it can sometimes feel like sensory overload when we're also meant to stomach watching teenagers get impaled over and over.",1
" To its credit, the film isn't sensationalistic nor is it political agitprop. While the violence is concrete and upsetting, it's virtually tame by contemporary Hollywood standards.",1
" If the narration is sometimes laid on a little thick, there remains something fascinating about these curious, balletic creatures.",0
" Sadly, this movie falls back on cheap jokes that simply aren't that funny. Fans of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron will still have a good time -- they're both unstoppably engaging -- but the truth is that this simply isn't good enough.",0
" The film itself feels uncertain, compromised and tentative. Those are very different qualities than brash, or bracing, or provocative.",0
" It peters out on the home stretch, but there's so much here that's impressive.",1
" We see a family at its best and at its worst, with the grumpy mealtime silences and the playful banter. Much of this is down to the first-rate performances from Elba and Marshall.",1
" Never mind the upcoming As Above, So Below or Ouija; this is the horror film of 2014.",1
" At any rate, the real bummer with ""Replicas"" is they spent too much time trying to explain how things were happening, when they should have just run with the film's inherent madness and put on more of a show. ",0
 Those who enter the cinema unstirred by either the sport or by the joys of stats are unlikely to come out converts.,0
 The whole package would have played better if the movie had bothered answering some of the questions it delicately raises.,0
 It's disappointing that a movie made by women and starring some of the best working actresses tackling a large subject couldn't add more to the conversation.,0
" Despite consummate filmmaking skill, it's hard to escape the feeling that this is minor Dolan: an inter-course palate cleanser between the giddy, audacious Mommy and his upcoming starry English language debut The Death and Life of John F Donovan.",1
 Nothing seems to matter and yet everyone tells us how much is at stake.,0
" Director David Leitch, replacing the original's Tim Miller, ups the action quotient while the script delivers a stronger story and even some occasional poignancy.",1
 Older viewers will enjoy the nonstop onslaught of playful observations and astute jokes.,1
" The imagery speaks for itself, and grill masters from around the world will learn something they didn't know.",1
" As a performance showcase it's intriguing simply because Eenhoorn and Nelson barely belong to the same species, so different are they in demeanor.",1
 The profoundly discouraging ending doesn't work.,0
" Like an artisan breadcrumb trail, God Helpthe Girl is made of disconnected parts yetones so tangythat it is easy to be tickled right until the end.",1
" Andrew Adamson's The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a much more elaborate, ambitious picture than the 2005 The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and it adds up to far less.",0
" The Clovehitch Killer is one of the best horror films to come out this year. It's intelligent and subversive, and it captures the banality of small-town life perfectly.",1
 Disney has another hit in its repertoire with this heartfelt story of sisterly love and one of the few films released in 3-D this year that splendidly incorporates the technology into the plot line.,1
 The boredom and dryness still dominate to blast away chances for connection like buckshot through a targeted pigeon's feathers and flesh.,1
" The title is intentionally ironic, and yet still feels like a bad and desperately unfunny joke. The spectacular all-star cast holds their noses and gamely dives in anyway, for the sake of Judy Greer's directorial debut.",0
 Matthew McConaughey goes beefcake in blah romcom.,0
 Hirsch and Dern are great in roles that prove much more complicated than initial assumptions.,1
" The combination of gore and giggles can work. But where Scream was funny and knowing and peppered with genuine scares, Sorority Row seems happy merely to play dumb and make a joke of its own derivativeness.",0
" A salty road trip tinged with sadness, sensitively handled by Linklater and his cast. Unfocused in places, but never less than diverting.",1
 Carmine Street Guitars sounds like it'd be far more engaging than winds up being. ,0
 Stay home and watch the WWF. The only difference is; they don't fight with swords,0
" As a presentation for the young audiences about the British researcher, Sherlock Gnomes offers timely and basic references, as well as a few creative sequences in 2D. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 You could freeze nearly any frame of Hell or High Water and you'd be looking at a work of art. It's stark and breathtaking and gorgeous to behold.,1
" ""Mommy"" is a passionate and generous portrait of three intersecting lives on the drab outer margins of middle-class society, told without condescension or sugary coating by an artist taking full command of his powers.",1
 Ending the light fantastic,1
" Though the results make for an interesting experiment and prove that Shakespeare is mesmerizing in almost any form, Whedon's work is a bagatelle not quite worthy of the Bard.",1
 A film that makes constant jokes about cliches and that somehow is full of them. [Full review in Spanish],0
" Jacob's Ladder is unique. Rarely is such an unconventional screenplay given this full-blown, $25 million studio treatment. It is a curiosity -- a mutant of a movie in an industry that specializes in clones.",1
" A film that worships itself with every frame. A sprawling, boisterous fantasy, but one that takes itself as seriously as if it were a documentary.",0
" Every now and then, director Joss Whedon executes a quirky camera set-up to assert that the film was created by him and not a team of marketing executives.",0
 A novel-like monument to the evil that plagues humanity.,1
" It's a sweet, slight movie that, while hardly a paragon of dramatic originality, executes a simple idea very effectively.",1

" Lean and mean, with a killer performance from Jeff Bridges, and star-making role for Halie Steinfeld.",1
" What might be a surprise, given the talents involved, is how relentlessly unfunny it is.",0
" The film had me alternating between a sugar high and drowsiness. One minute, I struggled to keep awake; the next, I was jumping in my seat. Neither extreme is particularly pleasurable.",0
" We like them, and we're not used to characters in a comedy like this being so blunt, honest, and self-aware.",1
" For all its flaws, Pitch Perfect 2 does all it needs to do to entertain those who enjoyed the original.",1
 Hollywood does kinda make sense now: it's a neverending frat party of talentless rich b*stards.,0
" Now I've got nothing against introducing young audiences to ""classic"" characters from bygone, pre-Xbox eras. But why do they all have to feel so corporate, so soulless, so creatively leaden?",0
" Lust, Caution is a disappointment coming from director Ang Lee, but it's a watchable one, and it rattles around in your head for a long time after you've seen it, as much for what it does right as for where it goes wrong.",0
 There's no escaping the hackneyed plot or Mayfield's conventional hand.,0
" Both Pattinson and DeHaan could have used more to do, but both actors put in performances that elevate the proceedings.",1
" The audacious, awesome concept cleverly snaps together, proving ordinary can be extraordinary.",1
 A highly imaginative if often darkly disturbing work that even at its most seemingly outlandish remains intriguing and involving.,1
" ""Kill Your Darlings"" doesn't really humanize these characters beyond half-drawn caricatures in an origin tale that wouldn't be out of place in an average super hero film.",0
" Kevin Costner gives everything he's got to the role, but writer-director Mike Binder, who worked beautifully with Costner on 2005's The Upside of Anger, finds himself on the downside of juggling stereotypes. ",0
" Few films have made military life, especially in wartime, seem so unappealing. But its achievement is also its detriment: soul-killing routine rarely translates to compelling art.",0
 Oscar-nominated actor Robert Downey Jr. usually has a knack for picking good movies. But Due Date is not one of them.,0
 You are easily drawn into the gangsta lifestyle and the movie's well written dialogue and briskly edited pace keep you interested.,1
 ...Parker has extended his story into areas of melodrama that recall the sentimental historical epics of Hollywood's golden age.,1
 It might sound like a superhero movie but Million Dollar Arm is a stirringly human drama based on a true story and a welcome reminder that extraordinary feats can be achieved by mere mortals.,1

" The Last Witch Hunter isn't really scary or exciting or engaging. It's not quite bad, but it isn't good either.",0
 It is perfectly content with its obvious and easy twists and never fully builds a deeper reasoning or logic to them. It is creepy mutterings and indistinct voices and ominous dialogue used in service of little more than their own existence.,0

" That it wastes the talent of two young actors with star potential is upsetting, that it insults its audience is frankly unforgivable.",0
 Vaughan brings such disregard to the film that its pedestrian on-court action might as well have been shot from the bleacher seats.,0

" As with fights, we understand at all times what we're seeing; Surprises aren't the result of whim or betrayal to the logic of the story. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 [de Aranoa is] a director at home with the small things that can make a film great -- interested in what keeps people together when everything around them is being blown apart. It's a wonderful gift.,1
 The second and third installments don't hold up because the Farrellys don't always adhere to Stooges' classicism when 'modernizing' them...there is simply no place for pee and fart jokes in the Stooges' lexicon.,0
 The Pirates! no doubt will play well to the whole family and with such enchanting visuals and astonishing attention to detail there's still much to treasure here.,1

 I never thought I would like anything made by two dudes named Jacques unless I could eat it for dessert or buy it from a truck stop men's room vending machine.,1
 Ill-conceived morality play set in the world of mixed martial arts is clearly a labor of love for writer-director David Mamet. It's just a labor for the audience.,0
 The Oath is (at first) a scarily realistic and darkly funny depiction of the political argument feedback loop that rips some families apart. But the violent last act allows Barinholtz to slip away without an idea for leaving that loop.,1
" While other countries do state-of-the-art schadenfreude, we are stuck in the steam age. We feed coal into the engines of old-fashioned heist thrillers.",0

 It's just too distanced to allow us to get involved.,0
" The characters in the film are fictionalised but based on the accounts of real survivors; fine to protect their identities, but dubious to deliberately twist the narrative to create additional sympathy.",0
" Gold has a terrific twist up its last-reel sleeve that is well concealed, pleasingly unexpected and which I wouldn't dream of spoiling... except to say that, clever as this twist is, it comes too late to rescue this metallurgical melodrama from mediocrity.",0

" It's all a bit much, yes, a bit exhausting, that's true, but then why on Earth would anyone expect otherwise?",1

" It's a hard film to like, but it's even harder to dismiss, simply because it's never less than absolutely fascinating.",1
" If all you do is look at performances, the historical drama is worthy of praise. Step back, and the overall production stumbles through writing mistakes, a drab look and a storytelling structure that puts the main event [too] deep into the tale...",0

" Los Adioses dares to show the duality of a feminist who, while urging her students to rebel against gender inequality, suffers in the privacy of their home that chronic machismo of Mexican society. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" Ritchie's movie was genuinely subversive and hilarious; Linklater's, despite amped-up sexual references (the team celebrates at Hooters) is merely a passably amusing excuse to pass a couple of hours in an air-conditioned theater.",0

 A brainless plot would be almost forgiveable were it not for the perverse depiction of innocents butchered in Invasion U.S.A.,0

" By the end of the film, you're likely to want to shoot Kevin Hart in the face yourself.",0
 The combination of Brooks' sharp writing and ear for dialogue with Mamet's neurotic charms is why The Boy Downstairs is such a surprising treat.,1

 And you thought Twilight was bad...,0
 You don't want to think too much about a movie like this. But neither do you necessarily want to support it.,0
" This isn't a despicable film or a lazy one; it's just a doodle, a glorified home movie by a filmmaker who no doubt has one hell of a Rolodex and a few favors to call in.",0
" The film shows a certain wit and a refined eclecticism: a director who in a few seconds combines Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, a quotation from Tennyson's In Memoriam and two monsters singing Beautiful Freak deserves watching.",1
" If you sit back, relax and just accept it for what it is -- an enjoyable, escapist Gothic pantomime -- you will go home happy.",1
 War of the Worlds' is a picture without a thought in its pretty head: the Tom Cruise movie to end all Tom Cruise movies.,0
" By the time it looks like Richard Dawson's Running Man crew created another stunt body double to get audiences all riled up, all the nostaglia has been sucked out thanks to a script unworthy of a direct-to-video sequel.",0
" Yogi Bear is pretty bad, but it's not apocalyptically horrid--and that's its biggest problem. ",0
" John Dahl's film is not as sinister or complex as its cinematic cousin, House of Games, but it is fun to see these young Hollywood studs (Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol) strut their stuff. ",1

 Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on.,0
 It's a huge testament to the actors that you can sympathize with a character one minute and hate him/her the next.,1

" The thrilling final hour is almost enough to make one forget how much of a labor it is to trudge through the first two-thirds -- almost, but not quite.",0
 Straight Outta Compton manages to keep its sharp teeth despite its adherence to form. The movie doesn't neuter N.W.A.'s story so much as mold it to a familiar model.,1
 What it lacks is even an iota of originality.,0

 The Last Laugh is a multifaceted and extremely thought-provoking documentary about the place of comedy in contending with the Jewish genocide during WWII. ,1
 Filmmakers were lucky to pick the perfect co-stars for 'Just My Luck.',1
 The film plays more like an extended prologue than a story in its own right. But some stunning set pieces and a beautiful animated segment redeem things considerably.,1

 This speaks to Winchester's overall failure of imagination-it's the sort of forgettable movie that could have been a memorable one.,0

" Lately, I've complained that ""gross"" does not equal funny. Well, ""weird"" does not equal ""entertaining.""",0
" The old clips are still a hoot, but there's a limit to how much compressed air a viewer can take, listening to a bunch of old men talk about how funny their friend was.",0
 It takes someone with Murray's reservoir of audience goodwill to make such a maddeningly passive character even worth watching.,1
 They threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans.,0

 A guilty pleasure...the knife's not blunt yet,1
" The choppy narrative, slipshod camerawork and uneven tonality suggest a longer movie that has been hacked or reshaped on the editing table.",0
" Cumberbatch does what he can to fill in the blanks and he is the real thing here -- all shyness, rudeness, acid comments, pathos, dazzling intellect and aching melancholy, while suppressing his velvety star charisma.",1
" The film starts out quirky, but settles for the routine. And characters, instead of deepening, flatten out.",0
" Michael Cera makes for a fine action hero. And while I'm at it, keep Brandon Routh as Superman!",1
" Blade Runner 2049 does what very few sequels can accomplish: it deepens our appreciation of its predecessor, while carving out its own niche in the spaces of our own imaginations. And the visuals it paints are in a word: breathtaking.",1

 Fukunaga packs the scenes with a documentary-like detail.,1

" Spinoza once opined that you couldn't use words to describe God, because by choosing any one or several, you would be eliminating the infinite nature of the deity. That essential inadequacy of words drives much of Nolan's stunning film.",1

 The force is gone with this one.,0
" The Last Animals doesn't offer solutions to the poaching problem so much as an outline of just how serious it is. But by reminding us throughout that human beings can transcend their worst impulses, it offers hope.",1
" Reactions to 8 Mile may be tempered by predispositions for or against the rapper, but the film cannot be faulted for lack of trying and may seduce skeptics with its energy and tone.",1
" Writer-director Ross lapses into contrivance, narrative and emotional, but it'd be worse without Mortensen's utter conviction and that rugged, out-of-time mien which has served him well in stories of extremity from The Road to Jauja.",0
" Simply put, Kick-Ass is a lot of fun, but it's packed with edgy content.",1
" Ultimately however, Every Act of Life too frequently veers into overly romanticized terrain...",0
" [W]hile the results are underwhelming, it is one of the better directorial efforts from Burton in a while.",0
" Blomkamp is clearly a man of ideas, but with the exception of District 9, he has been unable to fully articulate those ideas through character and action, a problem that is unfortunately confirmed by Chappie's muddled themes and misguided tonal shifts. ",0
" Rather than explore complex issues and troubling experiences by way of sci-fi future-historical fantasy, Battle Angel debases them-and its exemplary character-under the force of a blinkered and reactionary model.",0
" Honestly, it's in an awful state, altogether; a choppy, confusing, and structurally unsound thriller that struggles to make sense, let alone entertain.",0
" Everyone involved, including the audience, deserves a better movie than this, and for fans of the book, it's possible some out there might not find the film version a disappointment, but like everything else in ""Dark Places"" that seems unlikely. ",0
 Genuinely transporting.,1
" Woodenly acted and grinningly bland, this Amelia Earhart life story turns Hilary Swank and Richard Gere, playing the aviatrix's publisher husband, into virtual Thunderbirds puppets.",0
" David Gordon Green's Stronger is one half of a nuanced, intimate depiction of public and personal trauma... The other half of Green's latest is a far more formulaic affair, an 'inspiring' fable about triumphing over adversity.. ",1
" I'd call it a pointless endeavor, except now we might finally be able to pinpoint the source of Wilson's recent depression.",0
" Even Kristen Stewart is pretty interesting. No, really.",1
" Genial, sweet and old-fashioned teen comedy directed by a John Hughes alumnus",1
" In its way, The September Issue is about expert craftsmen toiling away at a factory, albeit an unimaginably glamorous one.",1

 Another tale (like 'Napoleon Dynamite') of a dreamy misfit seeking recognition and innocent love in an appealingly hermetic land of living cartoon characters. ,1
" A mysterious and intimate fable in the guise of gritty social realism, simply and powerfully acted.",1
" We are before a director at the peak of his powers, who has delivered a beautiful, ironic and provocative film. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Dove into deep psychological turf but without coming up with significant insights.,1
" The film's dialogue is so crude, its star so inherently - and paradoxically - likable, and its plot so lightweight that it essentially cancels itself out.",0
 Myers shamelessly steals from himself.,0
" The anger and the beauty are stirring in this picture about the origins and the growth of modern, 'second wave' feminism.",1
" An intriguing, time-hopping set-up is wasted on obnoxious characters, celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour.",0

 Creates so many possibilities that it may be likened to a rough draft awaiting editing. ,0

 Jeff Bridges brilliantly juggles the comedic and tragic aspects of the material. Too bad the film as a whole is a mixed bag.,0
" You may wonder how Moretz landed in the Cartoonistan of this dewy melodrama, and chalk it up to alien abduction. Yet she almost convinces you, solely on the power of her commitment.",0
" The historical context renders the fictional story trivial, while the fictional story keeps the audience removed from the history. We end up with an unimportant movie about important events.",0
 Hard-hitting independent thriller about child molestation and vigilante justice.,1
" This film is packed with wonderful eye-candy. The first ten minutes, or so, are dialogue free. They play so well that it is a complete disappointment when the dinos begin to talk.",0
 Fun references and welcome cameos add to the appeal of a film that's much more successful in its stupidity than when it strives to be smart.,1
 It's all too aptly named.,0
" With few exceptions, however-like a particularly awkward moment between Maura and the guy she's trying to woo (Ike Barinholtz)-the scenes generally feel like punch lines in search of something to hold them all together.",0
" There's no real depth or texture to the characters of any sort, sentimental or otherwise, and I say that as someone who can be brought to tears by a Hallmark commercial.",0
 Hardwicke's latest is undeniably generic.,0
" Not particularly good, but good enough for a comedy",0

" Except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway, there is nothing understated about The Invasion.",0
" Glazer's made an icy thriller of ontological and existential proportions. What does it mean to be human, to be alive? In Johansson he has a star who doesn't fear being a repository of those questions.",1
 Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork: an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley's source novel (About Schmidt) and an old Payne screenplay.,0
" This film is so choked with CGI battles, enormous mastodons, and flaming dark warriors, it gradually loses its grounding, making Arthur little more than yet another ""chosen one"" with mystical CGI-enhanced supremacy.",0
" A wildly simplistic ""autumnal romance.""",0
" Measured, assured and featuring across-the-board strong performances, Glass Chin in many ways is a tiny little drama about the virtues of character.",1
" Over the course of 95 minutes, we'll come to learn that the writer was, in some ways, a canary in the coal mine of today's rise in extreme right-wing views and the way many who espouse them have latched on to populist agendas in modern politics",1
 A gentle story that is no less profound for being so.,1
" Jude Law gives a bravura performance as the title character, but you can't escape the feeling that this 2013 crime comedy-drama could have been either funnier or more dramatic.",0
 A skillful thriller with something unexpectedly insidious on its mind.,1
" The Program is a drama, not a documentary, which allows it to flesh out the bones of this story into something approaching a minor Shakespearean tragedy.",1
" The film's only other notable ingredients, sadly, are the most rumbling soundtrack since Earthquake, a lot of jaw grinding by Ben Affleck, some narrative confusion remarkable even by director Zack Snyder's standards, and... hours and hours of your time.",0
" For a while their stupid rivalry, insults and petulant displays of outrage are funny, but like the talented child who won't be quiet for a second, the act eventually begins to grate.",0
" Clint Eastwood's biopic of J. Edgar Hoover has elements of a good drama, but merely brushes over the various controversies in a suprisingly humdrum narrative.",0
 Elvis & Nixon feels like a scrapped Drunk History segment that someone tried to build an entire movie around.,0
 I'm so glad it's over.,0
 Nicholson does indeed blow everybody else off the screen. Sometimes it seems this movie should be called Joker instead of Batman.,1

 The girls of the step team don't shy away from tackling the issue in their performances. They create routines that defiantly address the Black Lives Matter movement. They embrace roles for themselves as advocates.,1
" As an exploration of a specific point in life, this film is authentic and observant. But it has a tendency to preach at us, overdramatising issues rather than letting them play out organically.",1

" This wanna-be ""classic, old-fashioned, grand Hollywood production in the Gothic romance genre"" becomes ridiculously graphic and violent.",0

" As ridiculous as The Invasion gets, its competent acting, fast pace, and campy B-movie vibe keep you weirdly transfixed against your better judgment. ",1

" ..cannibalizes famous images and lines from all the ""Apes"" flicks, which is cute until the evident lack of new ideas becomes tiresome. ",0
" A remake that's an improvement over the original, and an English-speaking women's film that, for once, beats the French at the genre they do best.",1
" The film is persistently misogynistic and degrading towards women, racist at times, and Jennifer Aniston's character fantasying about two 14-year-old boys having sex is completely inappropriate.",0

" A lush, engaging take on the tale, filled with strong performances of both the musical and the dramatic variety.",1

" This is a thriller, though, in the sense that it is a thrill to watch Scott-Thomas give one of the finest performances of the year.",1

" With the success of Hostel and the Saw movies, another wave of cinematic nausea is upon us. Turistas tries to ride that wave all the way to the bank, but it's too timid and perfunctory to get very far.",0
 It's harmless stuff although the swerve into gritty social justice may not win it many fans among a fanbase more concerned with blow-dries than drive-bys.,0

" When the most convincing thing about a film is Jude Law's Scottish accent, you can be sure it has problems.",0

 It may be predictable but at least you see it's trying.,1

" Phillips pushes for laughs more than the show did, but still manages a weird mix of comedy, serious crime fighting and irony inside the scariest fashion decade of all time.",1
" A shamelessly derivative and preposterous would-be blockbuster that goofily fashions itself as a sweeping romance, time-travel sci-fi tale, and gallant period piece all at once. ",0
 Tedious exercise in navel-gazing.,0

" Director Vincent Masciale clearly scored one great location (the fancy house), and uses it to its maximum potential, which is the dream of all budding auteurs. Yet he fails to make it look all that interesting.",0

 Focal compositions and moody editing in the vein of Hitchcock help establish suspense and emotion without the need for excessive special effects or big-budget set pieces.,1
" 47 Meters Down is a decent, yet unremarkable, survival thriller that's little more than disposable summer entertainment.",0

" It might not be the frosted lemon tart that's been advertised for months, but it is solid, satisfying fare -- flecked with humor, grounded in pain.",1
" Thanks to a stupendously inept finale it ends up going nowhere, and by the time it fades to black the only question I had was what could have potentially been changed to salvage it.",0
" This attempt as a latter-day screwball romance, released in time for Valentine's Day, is charming in parts but also contrived.",1
" Antarctica is a beautiful blue paradise, and the final set piece, in which penguins and humans tap their way to a unity of green-minded spirit, is a small masterpiece of conciliatory wackiness.",1

" [Director Rachel Perkins] must maintain the sense of threat and danger without being too explicit. For the most part, she succeeds, supported by strong performances from a seasoned cast.",1

 Sullivan Stapleton in his first lead role after Animal Kingdom is actually quite impressive.,1

" Mungui may burden his protagonist with myriad problems, but the film never folds under the weight. ""Graduation"" is compelling throughout because Titieni conveys Romeo's anxieties through body language and facial expression.",1
" Typical of Dante's films, Small Soldiers is an unbroken string of pop culture in-jokes.",1
" I may be one of the few that loved this movie, but it was a blast, and I don't have any fear saying that. ",1
 Bella expends so much effort hiding its agenda that it doesn't have time to give us a story until the very end.,0
" Like the dolled-up women, the film is pleasing to the eyes and inscrutable. The mystery, though, is tedious rather than captivating.",0

" There's no cat, and the roof may not be made of tin, but it's plenty hot thanks to Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.",1

 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a perfectly suitable launch for what promises to be another lucrative franchise.,1
 A splendidly anarchic portrait of a world on the verge of a nervous breakdown.,1

 I can't recall another movie that cries out so incessantly for running commentary.,0
 It is nice to see Adam Sandler in a role outside his normal wild behavior. This is an enjoyable show with a lot of substance.,1
" [Franco's] free-spirited screen presence gives the film the kind of anarchic momentum it requires, mirroring its totally-serious-but-not-at-all-serious bent.",1
" Not only a triumphant exercise in dark and delicious romantic ambiguity, the pitfalls of being taken in are what this melodramatic thriller is all about.",1
 Will surely appeal to the easily pleased fraction of horror audiences...,0
 It is funny and well-acted but its emphasis on banter over incident makes it a minor entry in Linklater's filmography.,1

" A lightweight romance for the senior crowd, Last Chance Harvey does nothing in particular, but it does it fairly well thanks to stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.",0
" It has a central failure of courage and confidence, manifest in its need to caricature (bold in manner, timid at heart) and in its determination that nobody except Alex had better get a chance.",0
" Wherever he seemed to be headed after Up in the Air and Young Adult, it's a shame to see him responsible for a movie so flavorless and that makes so little sense. ",0

" Put together with affection and intelligence, this documentary portrait of Italian cameraman Carlo Di Palma gives us a handle on what made him a great cinematographer. ",1
" Capra's sense of humour is a little like that of Preston Sturges, though less caustic; and the film shows its stars at their best, Colbert as one of Hollywood's fresher comediennes, Gable as dumb-but-loveable hunk.",1
 That the movie is so funny without ever being funny at these people's expense is something very special indeed.,1
 Cooper plays the vicious rotter in the manner of an enraged Freddie Mercury auditioning for Alvin and the Chipmunks.,0

" A smart, ironic documentary.",1
" It's as fresh and alive as any big city, a movie you don't just watch but breathe in.",1
" For some insane reason, the makers of Primeval attempted to create a film that blends Anaconda with Hotel Rwanda, and they failed miserably.",0
" In a nod to Segel's chef Tom, the film engages in the pasta theory of filmmaking: Throw enough starch against the wall, and something's bound to stick. Some appetizing bits, yes, but not enough.",0
" If you're going to have a ghost in your movie, it might be a good thing to present a viable alternative to that ghost. ""Mama,"" however, presents a battle between two not very good options before crumbling like a sheet on a string.",0

" hile the new Clone Wars features improved visuals and increased action, the show's big screen premiere fails to exist as anything other than a 90-minute commercial for the inevitable toy line.",0
 Students beware: This is no sub for Cliffs Notes. The script takes more liberties with the text than Elizabeth Berkley did with that pole in Showgirls.,0
" A tasteless cartoon that uses the high-minded ideals of satire and social commentary to cloak the fact that it is shamelessly pandering to the most base, juvenile parts of our nature.",0
" The great intangible of chemistry isn't present, making Water for Elephants seem longer and slower than one might hope.",0
" While some of the film's ambiguity is welcome - we're never told why society has fallen apart, it's just a sadly acceptable given that it has - a good deal of it is disappointing.",0

 It's not Tatum's fault that he can't get into the character of an albino puppy man from another planet.,0
" If you're going to cut up your film's fight scenes to the point where you can't see who is doing what, why bother hiring Iko Uwais?",0
" For the uninitiated, The X Files: I Want to Believe may seem as musty and forbidding as one of those dank secrets that Mulder and Scully were forever digging up from some backyard, or fetid swamp, or their own aching hearts.",0

 A contender for the worst movie of 2019.,0
 Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.,0
 Chris Tucker...appears to be a white man in blackface plucked from a 1920s minstrel show.,0
" The director of Takers, a try-hard heist movie of clomping unoriginality and self-regard, is labouring under the embarrassing delusion that he's Michael Mann.",0
" This is an unashamedly old-fashioned children's movie, and a predictable message is part of the mission. But that's okay; what the movie lacks in surprises, it makes up for in whimsical fun",1
" Amanda Seyfried brings the mythologised Lovelace to life ...a surprisingly touching, extraordinary biopic. It certainly stands with Boogie Nights (1997) and Hardcore (1979) as one of the few good feature films about porn.",1
 [It's] fueled by genuine affection for its oddball characters.,1
" If the wardrobe to Narnia led to a restaurant full of world-class sushi, ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" would be the exquisitely shot documentary that filmed your journey.",1

" With its strong ensemble cast, witty script and eye-candy apparel, The Devil Wears Prada is the hottest trend of the season.",1

 Trevorrow never quite finds the moments that made the first film so transcendent.,0

 Schwarzenegger has checked out. He's an immovable object in a film that struggles and fails to find the energy that will carry him along. ,0
" In a double whammy of satire, Get Out upends all the expected tropes of the horror movie and gives middle-class white liberals a thorough skewering.",1
" The film is not always as focused as it could be, but it gives a voice to a community that is routinely denied one and a platform to Duggan's relatives, who claim that justice has yet to be done.",1
" Much like a balloon, this bland star vehicle is glaringly bright, light as helium and completely empty in the middle.",0
 This insane masterpiece shows the self-destructive properties of myth making and how they overlap with the downfall of a community damned from the beginning of time. ,1
" Where Adventureland announced an allegiance to freak-scene '80s culture and made a vital detail of one character's fluffing the title of a Lou Reed song, there's nothing so specific in Take Me Home Tonight.",0
" Vox Lux is a movie that makes you ask the question, Why am I supposed to care about any of this? ",0
" Buoyed by the nuanced performances of Stewart and Eisenberg, the 80-year-old Woody Allen creates a ravishing romance shot through with humor and heartbreak. ",1

" A deeply intense, detached museum piece -- hosting a small, intriguing plaque that might lead you to the denser story elsewhere, if you so wish.",1
" The film is let down, however, by some of the nuts and bolts: a half-hearted chase sequence here, a perfunctory exchange of dialogue there.",0
" For a movie about such a grim subject matter, the result can be surprisingly pleasant and even uplifting.",1
" What truly is most amazing about Spider-Man 3 (no pun intended) is that all objections are answered and all developments are resolved, even if at times it feels like they will never converge.",1

" [Director Angela Robinson's] movie is as improbable and magical as any edition of the ""Wonder Woman"" comic.",1
" The Crescent falls into a rut, drifting through long, languid sequences of vague menace and dicey dramatic choices.",0
" The movie is a mixed bag, but one filled with imagination and ingenuity, and as such as nuts as Monster Hunt proves to be it's also just enjoyable enough to make dealing with its wildly perverse lapses into pandemonium worth enduring.",1
" For a film about the evils of peer pressure, this nonsensical thriller sure wants to play with the cool kids ...",0
" Despite a few hiccups of self-seriousness, there is a certain goofy tone that gets struck throughout that speaks of promise for the works to come.",1
" Boy Erased has good intentions and a bland social message. Its goal may be admirable, but it doesn't make for affecting or memorable drama.",0
" Like Violet Kray producing a film about her twin sons. The movie doesn't ignore its subject's shortcomings, but it sentimentalises them and becomes increasingly incoherent as it proceeds.",0
" Instead of a hearty chowder of emotional highs and lows, first-time director Alexander Janko, who also adapted the script, settles for a diluted, Campbell's-Soup version of getting one's groove back.",0
" The thing has the feel of a vanity project, lacking urgency - like the work of a gentleman filmmaker who doesn't have to work.",0
" It's irreverent without crossing the line, and hits a tender note without lapsing into maudlin sentiment.",1
 As the final credits roll you feel like you've been on an emotional rollercoaster -- the same as you might if you'd just watched a moderately successful Hollywood disaster movie.,1

" ""Deadpool"" made not be known to a wider audience, and he's certainly not a courageous figure, but his debut is one of the better ones in the Marvel universe, adding some needed filth to the superhero routine.",1
" ...bloated, obvious and - most damningly - immediately irrelevant.",0

" With Shutter, that nerve-tingling soundtrack gets heavy use almost from the beginning of the movie. It becomes tiresome.",0
" Hitchcock/Truffaut packs plenty of cogent observations into a modest package, but avoids turning into a Cliff's Notes version of the book, instead using it and its history as a jumping-off point for new insights.",1
" A confusing, frustrating and failed attempt to intellectualise the Lock, Stock formula. Anyone know what this movie's about? Answers on a postcard, please.",0
" The pinnacle of 80s cinematic teenage angst. Frighteningly, it hasn't aged much.",1
" A godawful teen-magnet utterly devoid of entertainment value beyond the lure of its popular, photogenic cast and the dubious attraction of playing the ""guess who gets it next"" game.",0
" Jackie [delivers] a way for Portman to give one of the best performances of her career, maybe her best performance.",1
 Epps and Lathan make terrific teammates.,1
" It would take some actual work to get absolutely EVERYTHING wrong, and that looks like it might be the case here.",0
 It's a monstrous misfire.,0
" May the Saw mini-franchise, dulled into a bloody gore-fest bore after only three installments, rest in piece. A piece of hack-sawed-off foot here, a piece of a bludgeoned limb there.",0
 Is there anything rarer than an intelligent feel-good film that knows how to tackle urgent global issues with humor as well as a satisfying sense of justice?,1
" The movie is a tame affair, shot on calm, manicured streets; the interiors are decorated in pastels.",0
" In the end, there's little else to say, this new Cabin Fever a bloody misfire that shouldn't even exist in the first place.",0

 The perfect blend of heady philosophy and eccentric theatricality.,1
" The measured pace may be off-putting, but stay with it -- the accumulated wealth of detail invests the unexpected final scenes with enormous, shocking power. ",1
 It's some kind of trick when a film can make Jason Bateman look unsubtle.,0
 Doesn't punch nearly as hard without Coogler in its corner.,0

 It's more like an Ultimate Fighting Championship than a movie.,0
" In his debut as a director, Washington has a sure hand. His work with actors is particularly impressive.",1

" Like any teen story, To All the Boys has some growing pains... Still, we'll forgive it. Sure, it hits at core truths about new love. But it's still a fantasy, just not the bodice-ripping one of Lara Jean's teen daydreams.",1

" Making the minutiae of life hold continuous interest is no easy task, as demonstrated by [Cristi] Puiu's fledgling first feature, 2001's Stuff And Dough.",1
" Not only is the movie vile and callous, but also it's pretty darn stupid.",0
" The movie's tiresome joke is that, even the second time around, Josie still can't get it right.",0
" It's the exploration of their human frailty and their brokenness, and the step-by-step examination of the events that would lead to this barbarity, that give Blue Caprice its intensity.",1
" An oasis of bracing comedy that comes at just the right time, when we're parched for it.",1

" Love Story meets Dark City, which doesn't quite do justice to the moviegoing experience at hand, but comes close to describing the idiosyncratic, highly cinematic world Nolfi generates here for his filmmaking debut.",1

" With the sci-fi genre descending to disappointing new CG-assisted lows this summer (yes, I'm talking to you, Michael Bay), Moon ... is a perfectly timed little space oddity.",1
" From the spectacular opening battle scene ... to a final mano-a-mano showdown in the Coliseum, this film is at its best when it's at its bloodiest.",1

 Spaceballs meets the Six Clueless Samurai.,1
" There's a steady miscalibration to both its laughs and tension, the rhythms of the film seldom clicking into place...",0
" This is pretty silly stuff, even for a children's movie, and it sort of sells out the one original point the series used to have: Here was a prehistoric adventure that refused to go the yabba-dabbo-do route.",0
" Both stars do some terrific things with the material in the finale, but the movie has lost so much goodwill by then that it's hard to muster up a care to give",0
" Near-epic in preposterousness. So, swamped by CGI spectacle, wonder: what came first, overblown super-sneezes of action or the tissue-thin plot to wrap them in? Forget gods getting it on with humans; here, non-story meets quasi-show, begets a demi-star.",0

" It's got a style, a feel, a unique look, unlike any of those other murky combat flicks.",1
" Suburbicon could've been a great, funny, socially conscious film. Regrettably, it's just not that deep. It's a pretty random film that probably lives up to the expectations of the Cohen brothers.",0
 It's classically made and properly merciless. ,1
" Yes, it's history, but give it some context, some drama at least!",0
" Written and directed by Paul Weitz, Grandma is wickedly funny, emotionally intelligent and also very brave.",1
" The plotting is fairly hackneyed, with standard-issue office break-ins and routine car chases, right down to the inevitable ticking bomb climax. And the action lacks the furious kinetic urgency the Bourne movies brought to the secret agent genre.",0
" Cold Pursuit is thrilling, funny, brutally violent, and Neeson's best actioner since The Grey",1
 Director Hazanavicius and co-writer Jean-Francois Halin have created an impressively believable throwback to those late '50s international Hitchcock films.,1

 a well-worn piece of formula produced with just enough professionalism to make it clear that those who made it should have known better,0
" Inspiring, funny, touching, and delivered with craftsmanship and artistry.",1

 A deeply important and incredibly relevant film which breaks the often verboten subject matter on what parental life is really like behind closed doors.,1
" The film's many pleasures are in its slow reveals, the dangerously enchanting scenery being among them. There is much of Roman Polanski's cold eye for beauty in Corbijn's work.",1
" Filmmaker Cameron Crowe can't catch a break with Aloha, a Hawaii-set romcom that is a handful of stories struggling for a unifying tone, but is nowhere near as toxic as its advance buzz. ",0

 A rushed and scattershot affair.,0
" The Western, with its code of short tempers and cheap life, sprang from the Civil War, but few Westerns connect the dots to demonstrate how the war must have created hollow nihilists the way Jonah Hex does.",1
 Doubt is an old-fashioned talkfest which often betrays its origins as a play. It relies for its power on a series of stagey arguments.,0

" Lee's theme of human sexual expession is growing bolder, more graphic, more explicit, but not necessarily richer. I'd call it ""Lust, Caution, Overindulgence.""",1
" Taking its cues from Rocky rather than All the President's Men, [Peter] Morgan's compact, satisfying drama presents presidential interviewing as a gladiatorial event.",1
" Its funniest single line is a reference to the incest documentary Capturing the Friedmans. If nothing in that last sentence makes any sense to you, stay well away.",0

" It has a light, shaggy charm, and De Niro is at his most winningly comical.",1

 Nobody's Fool wastes its comic goodwill and performances by wallowing in the same tired story elements Tyler Perry has been milking on TV and in his movies for decade.,0

 Entertaining but ultimately disposable.,1
 Matt Johnson's feisty and flip debut feature inverts the dark iconography of school shootings.,1

" While bewildering for those unfamiliar with the Judd Apatow clan, for fans, this raunchy, daring and gleeful comedy comes up trumps.",1
" Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.",0

" Anna Faris can be cute and funny in the bubbly, ditzy, Goldie Hawn manner - as she proved in The House Bunny - but she's mostly shrill and irritating in lame chick flick What's Your Number",0
" The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point.",0
" Resistance is futile. Kenny Ortega... wows us with high-energy dance numbers, playful staging [and] a talented young cast .",1

 Russell distils his own toxic kind of nitrous oxide and pipes it into the cinema.,1
 One of the most refreshing aspects of The Hunt is its focus on societal dynamics rather than intricately plotted mystery.,1

 As cold as the Hudson River in January.,0
 An interesting comedy because far from the conventional genre can still surprise. [Full review in Spanish],1
" The film strongly evokes a certain segment of the American cultural scene from the 1950s through the '70s, though Plimpton continued working until his death in 2003.",1
 Its premise requires more sophisticated layering for the audience to really get on board with the notion that people leading very comfortable lives will suddenly go on a murder bender just because they can.,0
 Aptly seductive ...,1
 I did not know I could yawn angrily. This movie somehow proved it possible.,0

 ...the film comes off as nothing less than a huge disappointment.,0
 There's little Upside here.,0
" Vaughn gives his shiftless character a surprising degree of goofy charm, but he can't halt the film's inexorable slide into sentimentality and the limp script's lack of real wit leaves the endeavour looking misconceived.",0
" If the light from your mobile device weren't likely to disrupt the experience of others, I'd suggest that this is one journey on which you might consider bringing a book -- perhaps something by Agatha Christie.",0
" Scorch at least feels more like a feature-length film than The Maze Runner, which played like a sizzle reel for another film that would eventually follow it. It doesn't shed all the problems of that prior installment, but it's a start.",1
" An ebullient toast to grande dames: part homage, part camp, all artifice and a thoroughly entertaining, if light, confection.",1
" While it's not a great movie, I found it absorbing for the most part, an intriguing use of the unreliable narrator (which has been over-used in the past few years), gorgeous photography and a fine script by Erin Cressida Wilson.",1
" All Is Lost has moments of beauty, but the movie as a whole feels detached, almost clinical.",0
" James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is the most amazing ... no, wait: the most staggeringly amazing, jaw-droppingly triple-awesome unbelievable movie ever made.",0
" Ultimately, ""The Three Stooges: The Movie"" isn't funny enough for a comedy, which is too bad, because the three stars really worked hard to nail their characters.",0

" A character study of a guy who sabotages himself at every turn, along with one of the best soundtracks this year, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is another superb Coen Brothers film.",1
" Beautifully crafted all around, keeping Ida engrossing as it explores screen stillness, putting its faith in the power of subtle revelations as a means of suspense. ",1
 I can hardly call Bullet to the Head bad; it's just so bland on pretty much every level that there's not much to say but 'meh'.,0

 Too aware of Hollywood references to offer something even a little original or personal. [Full Review in Spanish] ,0

 A bitter but paradoxically entertaining fantasia.,1
 A spectacle of free brutality that gives amazing scenes. [Full Review in Spanish],1
" It is Mirren's fine performance that carries this film to the level of art. It takes guts to portray a living figurehead like Queen Elizabeth II, and Mirren captures her essence without ever stooping to caricature.",1
" Gray's film is a grand adventure, the sort that uses classic techniques but is never old-fashioned. By letting the story speak for itself, Gray unearths the crucial difference between curiosity and dominance.",1
 A game cast and lots of gamey R-rated shenanigans can't compensate for the silly comic contrivances that dominate The Big Wedding.,0
" Biggs may have the comically compulsive anxiety thing down pat, but he just doesn't have the screen presence to make it compelling - especially when breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience.",0
" An original work filled with bracing wit and sharp observations about character, class and social milieu.",1
" The saccharine US voice-over may have been replaced by Emilia Fox for the British version but there's still a mushy soundtrack, while a lot of the narration feels simplistic and sentimental, like a 1960s Science For Schools programme.",0

" Other actors would have milked the dramatic opportunities here for all they were worth, but Nixon and Abbott - the latter glimpsed briefly in A Most Violent Year - keep their sights on the heartbreaking inevitability of the situation.",1
" It's funny and undemanding, and Dench is excellent. So while Victoria & Abdul does have its shortcomings, it's also one of the films you'll definitely want to see for yourself this autumn.",1
" The only way to see ""Tron: Legacy"" is in IMAX 3-D, so the full visual freakiness can engulf you and be appreciated the way you used to light up at the thought of a laser show set to ""Dark Side of the Moon.""",1
" Yes, I know grief does strange things to people, and sex can be a way of expressing that distress, but making it the focus of Kidman's performance just seems forced and dramatically pointless.",0
" The film may not be a hagiography, necessarily, but it similarly turns its central figure into a wax figure, albeit one of deep sadness. Perhaps, though, Zweig fans will get more out of Schrader's film than neophytes.",1
" The paranormal is the least disturbing of the elements here, played with a gleefully operatic excess, and more than a whiff of the disturbing exoticism of Grand Guignol at work in the passions unleashed.",1
" The movie is nicely shot and sympathetically acted, but there's an odd lack of stakes and urgency ...",1
" What Harald Zwart's film lacks is the focus that might make this cluttered set-up more than the sum of its dour design, raging hormones, incessant skirmishes and wearying exposition.",0
" Is there enough Godzilla in ""Godzilla""? Folks, there is. There is just enough.",1
 An awful and graphically violent movie.,0
" It's very possible that the subject just doesn't deserve a biopic, that quite possibly Bettie Page's impact on the popular culture is more interesting than how she made that impact.",0
" Nothing is creepier than creepy children and teenagers, and the ones in ""Every Secret Thing"" are first-rate examples.",1
" The latest haunted house movie in the venerable ""sort of Insidious except so much worse"" mold.",0
" While it doesn't match the brilliance of 'Ed Wood,' it's a mightily enjoyable, and equally affectionate, tribute to a misguided moviemaker.",1
" Hittman's skill as an impressionistic filmmaker, giving us enough glimpses that we can fill in the whole, makes for an incredibly engaging viewing experience.",1
" Wants to be preeminent shock cinema, but doesn't have the [courage] to fully follow through on its promise of unbridled carnage.",0
" The film looks great, full of bright, primary colors that complement the slightly unreal world they depict.",1
" Without a clear purpose in mind other than telling a story that is mildly interesting if rather weird, The wild blue yonder never really takes off.",0
 ...could have worked as a bracing reminder that superheroes don't exist and that their movies can't save us - if only it had taken the implicit themes of the novel further.,1
" A love-tolerate valentine to the city, it feels more real than the gangster-gorged mean streets of Martin Scorsese's The Departed, and just as tortured as Clint Eastwood's Mystic River.",1
" A movie about a Scottish Peeping Tom who is sufficiently demented to give even Peeping Toms a bad name, it seems to be a lot less about fetish and voyeurism, than warped emotional espionage as pathological mommy love.",0
" Here is a sequel that abolishes whatever goodwill its predecessor engendered, a knockoff so contemptuous and empty it's cold to the touch.",0
" Even if Wanderlust is a bust, Rudd and Aniston will walk away from it with no repercussions as they both perform very well.",0

 The third big-budget attempt to tell the origin story of the Fantastic Four superhero saga on film hasn't turned out to be the charm.,0
" Extraordinarily restrained pacing, a tantalizing merge between imagination and reality, and Buckley's and Flynn's engrossing performances make this tale truly beastly.",1
 One of the hippest and most enjoyable movies of the 90s. This ROCKS!,1

" In Homicide's electric pop of language, Mamet provides a grand kind of stage for the ugly catalyst of jealousy and racial hatred that curdles in just about every character's mind.",1
" In Wall Street, greed was good because it made a great film. In Boiler Room, a little more greed -- or at least a hunger for it -- would have been great.",0
" Both brutal and lyrical, writer-director Park Chan-wook's existential nail-biter has torture scenes that will have you avoiding dentists, sushi bars and badly appointed hotel rooms.",1
" What makes the movie work is Damon's manic performance. His unflagging energy is appealing at first, but seems finally like the last recourse of a man every bit as desperate and pathetic as Tom Ripley.",1
" A perfect title - all the essence and flavor of Mike Judge with very little of his substance. There's no trademark satirical vigor or vitriol - just a handful of good performances and inspired scenarios wasted on a treacly, halfhearted narrative.",0
" Michell and company try to make you forget that Enduring Love begins, literally and figuratively, on such a high level before tumbling into the sordid Hitchcockian precincts of dangerous obsession.",0
" The bright spot in this boggy botched mess is Amy Adams, a fine and always interesting actress who sparkles and shines here despite the stilted storyline, preposterous improbabilities and an artificially sweetened storybook ending.",0
" A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by cliches and predictability.",0
" The best of Spanish comedy, with a few secondary actors who create memorable characters. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Perfectly serviceable B-movie noir.,0
 By the Sea is a fascinating mess.,0
 The quality of humor varies from very black to very silly.,0
 None of the visual flourishes can make up for the way the story sags in its final stretch.,0
 Fascinating documentary about legendary Soviet hockey team.,1
" [A] crass, trashy and none-too-funny comedy.",0
" Unlike its forbearers, it's easy to imagine this story sitting amongst episodes of the original series, but now it's amplified by its modernity instead of hampered.",1
" Compelling in the moment but adding up to less than the sum of its parts, 'Contraband' is pretty standard fare as far as pulpy thrillers go.",0
" Plenty [characters] drop Wiki-like factoids or spout lectures until you feel that, surely, you deserve an honorary degree for sitting through this National Treasure's European Vacation mixed with faux-educational drivel.",0
" Someone shoot me or worse, make me watch this for the millionth time with my older sister!",0
" So, it's a misfire-an interesting one, but a misfire, nonetheless.",0
" Like the best sports movies, McFarland, USA makes sure the action on the field is only one part of the cinematic spectrum. And in this case, it's a spectrum worth seeing.",1
 Guadagnino's movie shares with [Deray's film and Hockney's painting] a mood of eerie languor and sun-baked hedonism. Which makes the disruptive energy provided by Fiennes' exuberant and garrulous interloper all the more startling.,1
" A trio of strong lead performances elevate the material, but not to the level of a gold-medal winner.",1
 We haven't seen an end to the real-life drama after two years. Don't insult us by trying to give us one in two hours.,0
" Ultimately no more than an agglomeration of such high-caloric, giddy treats.",1
" There's a suggestion of a better movie in Close that makes it especially clear - and depressing - that Netflix is merely a content factory, churning out what it thinks people want to see.",0
" Like those it imitates, the film includes some energetic dance sequences and formulaic plotting that culminate in the obligatory final competition.",0
" Yet another wearying ""battle-of-the-sexes"" romp that's sure to please dumb people but didn't please me.",0
 It takes skill to make a cheesy creature feature well. The Sand is much smarter that it looks on the surface. Give it time and it will pull you in.,1
 An impressively audacious effort...,1
 After Hours is like one of those stories about a driver from out of town who takes the wrong turnoff on a big city expressway and winds up having an awful but memorable story to tell the folks back home... as long as he survives.,1
" A no-stars, no-plot, no-point vampire spoof about a group of coeds studying abroad in a haunted castle, Transylmania boasts the kind of acting and direction usually relegated to the adult section of your local video store.",0
 What we are left with is a family saga which is far more dispiriting than uplifting and which often makes very grim viewing.,0
 Offers a ride but not much joy in its overdone story.,0
 Human nature's dark side is the menacing midwife to the stillbirth of '60s idealism in the initially challenging and ultimately riveting United Red Army.,1
" A clunking great chunk of monkey junk, that smells a good few decades past its sell-by date.",0
" No less than in the glossy caper's 2013 predecessor, the plot rides a surging tide of ridiculousness and culminates in a pileup of unconvincing explanations.",0
" ""White Boy Rick"" is an engrossing-enough cautionary tale, if that's what it is. It's even an entertaining one, in an unsavory kind of way.",1
" One of the weakest films at this year's Sundance dramatic competition, Weapons is a violent crimer that rehashes familiar turf of the ""youth, crime and neighborhood"" movie genre, better and deeper explored in numerous indies of the past 15 years.",0
 Burton's sweet Gothic fairy tale has lost none of its charm.,1
" More than a century later, this is still a juicy story, and the actors don't back away from its more hysterical flourishes.",1
" With the fabulous voice cast in top form and characters it's impossible not to love, this is certainly one of the best family-film outings released this - or any - year.",1
 A sensuous tribute to the city of Naples and the emotional undertow of its diverse musical traditions.,1
 Predictable and not terribly clever.,0
" Begins as a story that has intriguing and seriously complex moral and ethical implications before giving way to what is a fairly by-the-numbers, beat-the-clock serial-killer thriller.",0
" Though the cast is energetic and the intrigues diverting, you'll have to distance yourself from reality to enjoy so much outlandish scheming.",0
" The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy.",1
 A hollow epic that searches for a big bang yet ends in a whimper.,0
" An undemanding, escapist 106 minutes, with a variety of stunts and chases. There are a couple of surprises and a few slightly cheesy moments, but it essentially does what it is meant to",1
" The acting from the top-notch cast is good. So, too, is the attention to period detail. The whole thing is just a little dry and ponderous.",1
" Especially because the young co-stars Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell are so appealing, The DUFF is charming, cheeky and relevant.",1
 Chipmunk Adventure is worth one toked-out viewing for Dody Goodman's gratingly senile Miss Miller and her description of the trio's daily breakfast menu.,1
" After a promising start, it fritters away any emotional connection with its audience early on, becoming a cold, meandering and tiresome exercise.",0
" In which one of Disney's finest achievements - the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture, of only three - is turned into a handsome but ultimately so-so cover.",0
" With a franchise hit such as Alien, the audience expects a certain amount of formula, and Scott certainly supplies it in the structure of the story and several of the characters.",1
" Engaging, intelligent, but direction doesn't quite live up to a first-rate cast.",0
 Riveting in its look at how to maintain old-school journalism principles when the bottom line doesn't always allow it.,1
" Where it does succeed, though, is in its depiction of a family in crisis...",1
 What emerges is an artist who lived for the stage lights but sank into darkness on his own.,1
 Luca Guadagnino has concocted a witches' brew of primal sisterhood that isn't for the faint of heart or patience. It's a visually and morally challenging film that will leave you pondering its existence and meaning long after you've left the theater.,1
 The second sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents defines uncalled for. Little Fockers is upchuckingly unfunny. ,0
" There's no real kick to all the wanton destruction, no sense of real thrill or peril, because the movie, which was written by Simon Kinberg (and rewritten, and then rewritten some more during production) chickens out.",0
 A fun fim from a fascinating man.,1
" Sweet Bean's gentle, quiet drama shares DNA with the work of Kawase's compatriot, Hirokazu Koreeda. Sweet by name, sweet by nature.",1
" Cursed isn't a very good movie, but it's more an uninspired letdown than a flabbergasting turkey.",0
" Didn't the International Court of Justice at the Hague declare ""We Built This City"" the audio equivalent of a war crime? ",0
 An adventure in pure imagination that plays to the smart kid in all of us.,1
 It's depressing to see a deluxe cast wasted on such by-the-numbers material.,0
" This is less a Fast movie than A Summer Action Picture, and nobody looks like they're having much fun.",0
 A blandly feelgood documentary about aspiring young ballet dancers.,0
 It's no sort of masterpiece. But The Lone Ranger is a good deal less dreadful than advance word has suggested. ,1
" Literate, pleasant, vaguely arty, good enough.",1
" Al Daradji directs with a sure hand, avoiding icy realism and chest-beating melodrama. The result is warm, human and quietly devastating.",1
" This awful ma-full flick should have been even more honestly titled Lazy Movie. The premise is numb-dumb obvious and the plot barely furthers it. As the movie wears on and on, the moms' bipolar-anxiety about being only 'good' or 'bad' gets stupider. ",0
" Bhoomi is a revenge drama that tries a lot to be bold, brave and advocate feminism but wants to stay in the comfort zone of a typical Bollywood masala film. The result is stereotypes, over-the-top melodrama and a predictable story.",0
 The film doesn't know or care who Anwar El-Ibrahimi is outside of how his plight affects the white folks connected with him.,0
" ""Kin"" is not a snoozer, at least, and the Baker brothers are certainly not untalented, but their genre-mashing experiment doesn't work on any emotional level.",0
" A very fragmented, tonally disjointed film. ",0
 [T]he movie just comes across as a hollow critique of stardom on the sides of both the star and the general public.,0
 It just goes on and on - the cinematic equivalent of watching sand pouring through an egg timer that takes well over two hours to empty.,0
" Parkland works when focusing on the little things, making us feel like true witnesses to history rather than judging it through the benefit of hindsight.",0
" A triumph of style over substance, Mann's noirish crime drama is B-level narrative wrapped in a visually sumptuous and viscerally thrilling package.",0
" The fans won't mind but the film feels overlong, the emotional curve fails to ignite and the ending is anticlimactic. Jennifer Lawrence is this sequel's greatest asset",0
 The Namesake is an understated picture that draws a viewer completely into the world it presents.,1
" The reveal is a bit predictable, but a couple of fake-outs keep things interesting along the way.",1
" The film is a scrappy delight that opens up feelings you can't laugh off. Tomlin, the sorceress, leaves you dazzled and devastated.",1
 The few laughs I got were not worth suffering through the rest of the movie.,0
" All that's expected from the leads is that they put forth a competent degree of mimicry; the secondary characters, meanwhile, are left with little to do but flounder.",0
 A messy and unsophisticated cop drama that quickly stumbles into a spiritless slumber.,0
 Like a Charlotte Bronte adaptation directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Utterly brilliant.,1
 It's Mulligan to whom the biggest plaudits belong. But the rest of the film can't quite live up to her.,1
 Black Panther feels like the right movie we need... right now. ,1
 As harmless and predictable as an episode of 'The Facts of Life' (although I don't think any of Mrs. Garrett's girls ever had a pregnancy scare).,1
" Although films about adolescents stumbling urgently toward sexual self-identity are plentiful, most are put to shame by the delicacy, poignancy, and honesty of Nico and Dani.",1
 The best thing about 'Grudge Match' is the utter lack of lame old-timer jokes and - especially but especially - Viagra gags.,0
 The swooping 3D musical numbers pop with colour - but it's hard to see where this feathered-family franchise could fly next.,1
 You may scream & wince more from the pain of witnessing poor Cary Elwes overact his way through the film than you will from all the bloody scenes in Saw added together.,0
 This sappy romantic comedy is a weak stab at capturing lightning in a bottle again!,0
" It's one of the more viscerally accurate portraits of parenthood, and specifically motherhood, that the movies have recently given us.",1
 This would be a good film to watch if you were cramming for your Indie Films of the 2000s final and didn't have time to see everything on the syllabus.,0
" When you go to a futuristic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic barn dance starring Tom Cruise and his space guns, you expect a little zap with your thoughtful pauses.",0
 Superior to Olympus Has Fallen in every conceivable way.,1
" Puenzo's initial premise is more promising, though, than her sensational tone.",0
" The Chronicles of Riddick is many things, but it's never dull.",1
" Although the plot is pretty bare-bones, it's propped up by plenty of gratuitous dialogue and imagery that do nothing to further the story.",0
" When [Moore] embarrasses her son by forcing him to read a passage from de Sade's Justine (introduction by Georges Bataille!), ... it's a potent familial cruelty to place alongside the best of Davis and Crawford.",1
" Danny Strong's film suggests dramatic Tetris, and it leeches J.D. Salinger and his process of any mystery.",0
 The entire final third of the plot appears to be missing. ,0
" Ultimately, not only does this epic enlighten but one hopes it may help to rekindle some of the revolutionary spirit that seems to be sadly lacking in contemporary society.",1
" This is a trifle too sweet to dip as dark as despair -- at worst, we know Anne will learn self-reliance.",0
" With the plot so under-nurtured, the action sequences needed to be spectacular, but many audiences will probably leave the cinema unsatisfied.",0
" Predictable, but Pacino's performance is a must see. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" may not completely defy expectations, but it effectively delivers the genre goods while also providing something a bit more reflective",1
 A chronological brain-teaser confounding enough to keep you busy trying to figure out whether those holes are in the story or in your logic.,0
" As compared to the overwrought, too-many-irons-in-the-fire second installment, Iron Man 3 proves its metal, oops, mettle, once again.",1
" A failure, but an interesting failure when you step back and contemplate the project as a whole. Not really anybody's idea of a good time at the cinema that, though, is it?",0
" It's all like first-draft Mamet, or Tarantino in a pissy, self-sabotaging mood: neither clever nor funny, but convinced it's both.",0
" An atypical horror movie that could have been great but instead settled for mediocrity and recycled tropes, Oculus is a frustrating near-miss. ",0
 A vanity project that is more than a little bit silly when you think about it.,0
" Pixar tops itself with its new animated offering Up, a movie so visually and emotionally skillful that it makes Monsters, Inc. look positively antic, Toy Story seem like mere child's play, and WALL-E appear as sentimental fluff.",1
 Proving that low-budget genre-based entertainment can be just as easily ferociously inventive and character-driven as its big-budget competition can be lazy and boring.,1
" Ultimately, Hopkins' directorial touch is a little too light, the script a little too flat, and Lost in Karastan cries out for more focused characterisations and a more pronounced sense of black comedy.",0
 Perry's fight choreography is exceptional -- you don't have to be a fan to follow the action or get thoroughly caught up in each match. ,1
" Ultimately, ""Whiplash"" isn't just about jazz - and it's not necessary to be a fan of the music to enjoy the film - but about life.",1
" L.A. Confidential, this isn't, but still worth a look, although you might as well wait for the DVD.",1
" If you showed the Sin City midnight world in smaller doses, as a weekly series on late-night cable television, the slick graphics and cold kink might be more compelling.",0
" Stripped of the novel's kudzu-like excess, the story loses its timeless, nightmarish, existential power and becomes another cautionary tale in which beautiful and privileged post-9/11 young people learn the world is no longer safe for Americans.",0
 A beautifully majestic film ... Yeoh's powerhouse performance [is] the type of acting that tends to warrant awards attention.,1
 Immensely powerful in its invocation of the true meaning of Christian charity and its symbolism.,1
" There's nothing clever about this deliberately rude and vulgar comedy, but certain audiences will find it absolutely hilarious.",1
 Watchable romance with an intriguing premise and engaging performances from both Tatum and McAdams...,1
" Riddled with poor lighting, inappropriate use of music, and a plot you could fit in a tea cup, ""The Last Exorcism"" has all the appeal of a glorified, but poorly shot, student film. ",0
 Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie.,0
" Shot for approximately seven dollars, The Dark Tower is a muddy, unattractive picture with terribly choreographed and filmed action. ",0
" ""Logan"" self-consciously aspires to retire the steel-clawed hero with epic grandeur, and the results are often rousingly bleak. And yet, the risks taken only make the formulaic redemption story and cliched emotional underpinnings increasingly frustrating.",0
" Roger Rabbit, what did we do to deserve this?",0
" Envy's horrid mix of poorly done black comedy and the incessant striving to be zany by Black, Stiller, and former Upright Citizens Brigade member Poehler makes Death to Smoochy look like a masterpiece of comic nuance.",0
" Ms. Wells is 10 times funnier and smarter than Louis CK. Her film is a reminder of what a crime sexism is. It not only harms women, it prevents the real cream from rising to the surface.",1
" Miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning, and his imagination so vivid, that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period, no timeout.",1
" A remarkable aesthetic exercise, without a doubt, but frankly sterile. [Full review in Spanish]",0
 There's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong. This is an hour and a half of daydreaming.,0
 Partially successful.,1
" As misogynistic as anything I've seen in ages, it's tricked up with enough fancy cinematography (by Guy Dufaux) to guarantee it sub-Hitchcockian credentials of the sort that some reviewers eagerly hand out to Brian De Palma.",0
" Despite an opening credits sequence that directly compares the stars of the new movie to the likes of Yul Brenner and Toshiro Mifune, this run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up isn't exactly an instant classic.",0
" Despite the promise of the title, this a fairly stale offering, plodding through the beats of a well-worn subgenre but failing to add much more than a foul mouth.",0
" When not being a colossal bore, Tarantino takes pleasure in offending our moral sensibilities with his adoring portrait of a natural born killer with a thirst for revenge.",0
" In a way, Freddy finally makes sense in this version of Elm Street, but Robert Englund's original Freddy is still preferable to Haley's pervy Groundskeeper Willy. ",0
" Enchanted isn't something to get worked up over -- not only because it's so boring, but because it can't even be bothered to adhere to its own internal logic.",0
 This is probably the most fun to be had at the multiplex so far this year.,1
" Wan knows how to sustain tension through terror, though he could have abbreviated the flabby middle of the movie.",1
 Almost everything is bland pregnancy humor that's been done to death in other films. I don't know why this movie exists. ,0
" A wilfully old-fashioned, oddly soothing sprawl of cool cars, heavy weaponry, chain-link fences and cackling crooks.",0
" Miley is charming, but every element of this concotion is calculated for commercial reasons, which would have been no problem if the picture was less formulaic and more engaging or entertaining.",0
 Resembles a direct-to-video movie at almost every ill-advised turn because of its overall air of moronic silliness.,0
 This Far From the Madding Crowd is to be commended most for the nuances that it never sacrifices.,1
 The material is so far removed from what it originally was ... that the stretch has made it shapeless.,0
 I can't imagine another film coming out this year that will beat these 300 in the art department.,1
" Do any of these various jump scares ever register? Not really. For that to happen, the movie would have to have built up tension and suspense, which I guess it figures it isn't required to do.",0
" It's ""Groundhog Day"" except it features Tom Cruise instead of Bill Murray, which can't make it better.",0
" A Dangerous Method features three potentially fine central performances, but each one is undermined by the weight of some often heavy duty dialogue.",1
" It's an overwhelming experience to see how man and dog have magnetic pulls on one another, but the journey to get to that place of trust isn't as easy as giving a dog a bit of a ""Puppy Snap.""",1
 he Missing Picture is a fascinating and vital film of a history that too often remains a footnote or a death toll in the margin.,1
" [We see] cultural, biological, and historical perspectives ",1
" The unflinching slicing and dicing is viscerally brutal, but without sufficient character development Lawless simply feels lifeless.",0
" Whilst it's not the masterpiece we so desperately wanted it to be, Australia still manages to be a good time at the cinema.",1
 Shyamalan's Village provides an open window into his gifts - and flaws - as a top-flight director,1
 The Lethal Weapon movies were all about charismatic actors breathing life into stock characters. That doesn't happen with Willis and Def.,0
" It's an interesting piece of counter programming on New Line's part, the only question is why didn't it go direct to cable?",0
" For its terrific wildlife action and sweet human scenes, the film is overwhelmingly worth seeing.",1
 All great films have imagination; this one also has the sense of experience.,1
" McQuarrie and Cruise are determined to entertain us to within an inch of our lives, or die in the attempt.",1
 Goodnight Mommy (2015) is an unsettling horror film built on scars (physical and psychological) that upset the connection between a mother (Susanne Wuest) and her sons...,1
" Incoherent and pointless as it is, These Final Hours moves with commendable swiftness.",0
" This is being marketed as an ideal film for moms and daughters to see together on Mother's Day weekend. A long, awkward brunch sounds more fun -- and more truthful.",0
" A charming film that raises, rather than replaces, the original Wizard of Oz. ",1
" All excitement and anticipation aside, no two ways about it this sequel is also a frightful disappointment, the fairy tale clearly over no matter how much I and so many others would rather wish otherwise.",0
" For something so full of stars and whose plot is all about jewels, Ocean's 8 does lack a little sparkle.",0
 A better title would be The Dumb and the Deafening.,0
 This sequel actively devalues the compassion-on-the-knife-edge-of-misanthropy that distinguished the original in favor of a mainstream gross-out cartoon.,0
" While younger kids will likely be entertained to one degree or another by this film, adults might hope some global warming will put an end to this particular ""Ice Age."" (Full Content Review for Parents - Scares, Crude Humor, etc. - Available)",0
" The Avengers of old age, a team of superhero actors considerably enhance this sweet but slight look at taking life by the tail.",1
" Everything and everybody else just seems here to support Robbie: If nothing else, her performance here is a compelling argument for her to get that Harley Quinn stand-alone film made, already.",0
" Despite its seemingly canned plot, [it] commits to delivering a glimpse into that truth spiced with the joy of optimism rather than the easy placebo of certainty.",1
 It's too bad that a movie so lovingly steeped in music hasn't more rhythm and flow.,0
 Enjoyable not only because it shows the duplicity of spinning but because it allows its characters to revel in the joy they experience as contemporary con artists.,1
" You'll need not only your own WABAC machine, but also a shower.",0
 One of the best films this year - or any year. Certainly the finest film about auto racing I've seen because it focuses on the human element.,1
 Whatever Works is a slapdash composition built around a single note.,0
" Sublimely awful, director Gregor Jordan's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' dystopic vision of '80s era Los Angeles bounces between a slew of unlikable reckless characters.",0
" It's a swirling, upsetting picture that gets bigger and scarier the more he talks.",1
 The would-be emotional centerpiece of his three-hours-plus adventure flick is the most juvenile romantic tale of 1997.,0

" MacFarlane has corralled a great cast, which makes it especially disappointing that the movie's merely OK.",0
" The parade of bad taste and tacky outfits sometimes brings to mind early John Waters minus its spirit of pre-punk camp, or Quentin Dupieux without the dream logic and camera sense.",1
" A tough, entertaining homage to the kind of gritty '70s crime film that long ago gave way to a slicker yet tamer form of action movie ... Both the studio's cut and Helgeland's cut work about equally well.",1
 ...it seems likely that fans of Rawls' book will find plenty to embrace here.,1
" A messy, messianic slasher/blaster in the Matrix Half-Loaded tradition, all nonsense plot and baroque costumes, sets and special effects.",0
" A bloated, simplistic, cartoonishly violent film.",0
 Highly-stylized piffle designed to titillate and satiate bloodlust while slowly turning your brain to mush! ,0
 Woody Allen's latest venture takes him into new territory and moving locations has inspired him to deliver one of his strongest premises in years.,1
 This C.V. Whitney production is undoubtedly one of the greatest Westerns ever made.,1
" Tonally adolescent, the film is enraptured with the emo-ness and ecstasy of love...Love may be all you need, but, sheesh, give it a rest for a second.",0
" Lanthimos again exhibits his aptitude for creating insular, ruthlessly regimented microcosms through which to unleash his scathing satire.",1
" Inspiring documentary, highlighting this 'notorious' trendsetter's dissenting opinions.",1
" And apparently there's life after Downton Abbey. In a 180-degree departure from that show's scheming Miss O'Brien, actress Siobhan Finneran plays Swifty's abused, soft-spoken mum. She and the boys are wonderful.",1
 Let's all come together and hope to God that nothing as degrading as this garbage is released as a theatrical feature or published as a book ever again.,0
" Instead of nodding off, however, I found myself both laughing at Kumagai, who in close-ups looks like a gray-bearded Gulliver as he inspects his garden's tiny wildlife, and sharing his fascination and joy.",1
" Hooper could have taken this story in a bolder direction, but instead he tells it with the same kind of tasteful restraint he brought to The King's Speech. ",1
" It is just too much of a pill to swallow to follow these dumdums on their quest to save poor Maddie. Honestly, Maddie might be better off in the light.",0
 A sluggish biblical epic that might have been more bearable if it had a much higher campiness quotient.,0
 Moves at a brisk enough pace to keep its rampant stupidity merely annoying rather than actively offensive.,0
" An intriguingly endearing kooky fest of witty dialogue that has no clear plan of where is wants to end up, short of a musical number to smooth over all grievances and differences.",1

 The Girl on the Train offers intrigue and a few red herrings but doesn't provide a knockout punch. ,0
 A richly emotional character-driven drama.,1

" This is a poorly executed mess, and one can't help but feel let down by the blandness of it all.",0
" Portman's terrific performance in Anywhere But Here is replete with razor's-edge emotions, a watchful stillness, and an exact physical sense of how a teenager struggles to fit into her own body.",1
 A sure-footed action thriller.,1
" Thanks to Saville's tightly controlled direction and a superlative cast, the mere exchange of glances builds as much suspense as the kinetic action sequence that opens the pic.",1
" Irritating, boring, gross, silly.",0
" A splendid space saga so spellbinding, I won't complain about their resurrecting that infuriating, infinitive-splitting catchphrase, 'To boldly go where no one has gone before!'",1
" Despite some hearty humor from Adam Sandler, co-star Kevin James and a handful of well-cast character actors, the film's contrived plot and discriminatory jabs ultimately make Chuck and Larry a tactless engagement.",0
" The film's premise is doubly clever and self-conscious: Jay and Silent Bob are moved to action by Hollywood's phoniness, and their story is all about the resulting manufacture, destruction and confusion of identities.",1
 In typical (Jon) Stewart fashion ROSEWATER turns controversial political events into boisterous humor.,1
" Nothing buoys the occasionally claustrophobic Son of Joseph more than the radiant, freckled face of newcomer Ezenfis ...",1

" As an action-thriller, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is more or less competent. As an heir to the Jack Ryan mantle, however, it is less so.",0
" Adapted by Nicholas Shakespeare from his own novel, the screen version is a muddled mess of nutty political shenanigans, murky thought processes and a doomed love story.",0
" Playwright Stoppard and director Wright make a valiant but unsuccessful effort to modernize the classic, resulting in film that lacks emotional power and peformance by Knightley that doesn't begin to oompare with Garbo's or Vivien Leigh's.",0
" Everyone's favourite maverick nonagenarian guides us through a lively and engaging account of her inspirations, work practises and engagement with the audience.",1

" Olsen widens her eyes and parts her lips prettily, but she's a wan, recessive presence and an increasingly problematic one as Therese and Laurent are engulfed by mud and blood.",0
" Retaining all of the humor and charm of 2015's 'Ant-Man', this marvelously delightful and energetic sequel never takes itself too seriously.",1

" In the spirit of poorly mimicking Hemingway, I'll offer my six word review: Cuban permits don't make good films.",0
 The beautifully made and carefully-crafted film starts off as an over-the-top black comedy sizzling with snarky satire. Then it paints over that canvass and becomes a darkly humorous horror parable as the painter stalks his prey from beyond the grave.,1

 Deadpool 2 is terribly constructed. Why things happen doesn't really make much sense. The plot is an illogical mess of action scenes and joke setups.,0

 It's too strangely hidebound by overused dramatic tropes to inflict serious damage.,0
" The event of the summer? Maybe. After a hideous May and June, unadulterated competence feels like an event.",1
" Martin Scorsese's keyed-up, irreverent tone frequently fails to distinguish itself from the grunting arias sung by the oily paragons of commerce his film evidently intended to deflate.",0

 Only Sandra Bullock shines as Harper Lee.,0

 A raunchy but unfunny juvenile Christmas buddy comedy flick for the stoner crowd.,0
" Superb storytelling, tense action, wonderful use of music, a lively sense of fun and Tom Cruise at his very best in a tale that is - well - extraordinary. In short, it's great entertainment.",1
" This is a b-grade thriller, but with A-list directing and acting. Jackson turns this routine thriller into something worth going to the theater for.",1
" The real letdown comes from knowing that the film is from Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, the husband-and-wife writing-directing team behind the thrillingly inventive American Splendor.",0
" Too good for action, its action is flaccid; too good for hip, its hipsterism is tired.",0

" The movie, more tear-jerker than romantic comedy, gets at how painful, awful and, ultimately, worthwhile it is to be a parent, and, if it takes its time getting to that message, that makes sense.",1
" The kind of personal film that fails in a way that makes your teeth ache. It's obviously a labor of love on the part of its first-time writer-director, but as a coming-of-age memoir it lacks charm, originality and taste.",0
 A movie like this stands or falls by its lead performance. Fall it does.,1

" This messy, disjointed film marks the directorial debut of Idris Elba and it gives me little pleasure to state that he should stick to working in front of the camera instead of behind it. ",0
" Dr. Dolittle clocks in at a cool, crisp and blessed 85 minutes. This is movie bliss.",1
" After the premise settles in the dust just as it should, the movie crumbles into one big mess where the characters spurt out some incredibly dumb dialogue and act like they are in some sort of Spice Girls music video.",0
" Annihilation is a remarkable achievement. It lingers, burned into your thoughts, branded on the brain. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, and the fact that it exists at all is something worth celebrating.",1
 The dismaying thing about this spoof of chick flicks is the lack of satirical perspective: you can't do irony while assuming the audience knows and cares about nothing beyond a few hit romantic comedies.,0
" What the film suffers from is a lack of direction, a lackadaisical pace and effects that don't get the blood pumping.",0
" You can make out that the activities are insidious, and the actors do their best to convey shame and discomfort at being constantly humiliated. And yet I could not help but feel as though their true horror was being held back from me. ",0
 Boastfully bloody and violent fun.,1
" Writer-director David Michod (""Animal Kingdom"") likes his violence, but what he's really offering here is an odd bond between two severely damaged men who have little in common beyond the damage.",1

" A feel-good charmer with an important message, Pride will have you clutching your sides, wiping your eyes and punching the air in triumph. Could this be this decade's Full Monty?",1
 It's a pitch-black satire of modern marriage and one of the most unsettling films of the year.,1
 The structure works because it manages to put the viewer in the same state as Leonard.,1
" Among the lesser of the Sleeping Beauty story's many incarnations, but at least it's an ambitious failure.",0

 The dinosaurs have an attitude to them -- a yo-Adrian swagger -- that makes for cheeky fun.,1
" Built for obvious uplift, but Schmitz, a South African-born filmmaker of German descent, has a unique sort of insider's outside view, one might say, that keeps the movie from tipping over into the maudlin or contrived.",1
" What's curious about the movie is that you can tart it up all you want, but Dickens' words still resonate, his characters still infuriate, frighten and touch, and there's still satisfaction to be had in his tale.",1
" Rather than reveal a showman, The Reagan Show in the end imitates one.",0
" Theron's a perfect avatar for Cody's irrepressible empathy for her subjects, wounded and loving in equal measure, and she's hardly been more watchable.",1
" The Last Jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy, purpose it had yet to prove.",1
 Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.,0
" This exhilarating tale of a winsome Spanish nightclubber who finds herself spontaneously caught up in a bank robbery... is undeniably a stunt, but one suffused with a surprising degree of grace and emotional authenticity.",1
" It's an affecting portrait of one woman's lifelong struggle to come to terms with her survival, a state for which she is profoundly grateful even as she is damaged by it.",1
" While Beasts of No Nation is far from easy viewing, it is powerful, urgent and heartbreaking filmmaking and a stark reminder of how boys become beasts in a war without end.",1
" A triumphant, feel-good, laugh-out-loud, sports biopic.",1
" It's like Schindler's List crossed with The Sound of Music, and Roger Spottiswoode directs it in a stiff, lifeless, utterly dated style of international squareness.",0
" This sour, repetitive fare fails to feed our hunger for either laughter or enlightenment. It's all empty calories and reactionary chic.",0
 A low-budget sci-fi thriller with worthwhile questions about the relationship between human beings and super-intelligent robots.,1
" ...we can see Bresson's influence on Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, Yvon's curtly procedural trial and subsequent acts a precursor to ""A Short Film About Killing.""",1
 ... a devious and fascinating feature ...,1
" Paul Giamatti is one of those actors whose presence in a movie generally validates it, and Barney's Version is no exception. He manages to make a central character with few-if any-admirable traits not only bearable but downright compelling. And...",1
" Maybe for today's computer-gaming sprogs, speed, violence and animation (in all senses) are enough.",0

" Her performance makes this film digestible, but also makes us yearn for her to receive better roles in the future.",0
" The ideas evaporate and the gun violence, ultimately, is all that remains. Which, perhaps, is deliberate, and very American, but deadening all the same. ",0
 Director Roger Spottiswoode's skills for physical production outpace his ability to generate vitality and bring out the best in his actors.,0
" It's the kind of female-centric syrup that isn't conceived creatively so much as it's calculated mathematically. But for a certain audience, it might be good enough.",1
" Debuting director William Brent Bell, who wrote the script with producer Matthew Peterman, keeps the pace brisk and the pot bubbling.",1
" Easily one of the best and most surprising films of the summer, an edge-of-your-seat actioneer that represents the very best that science fiction has to offer.",1
" An unsettling, minimalist meditation on the hidden dangers of teen romance, which signals its director as someone who's already marked out his own distinctive style.",1

" [Documentaries] impose order on chaotic experience, structure narratives, conjure viewing pleasures. Presenting Princess Shaw simultaneously exposes and obscures this process.",1
" Alfonso Arau's A Walk in the Clouds is a lush, old-fashioned melodrama, and almost endearingly inept.",0
" More ordinary, perfectly serviceable, somewhat smart and mostly entertaining.",1
 The script tries to be funny but simply falls flat. And the premise the tale is built on is somewhat bizarre.,0
 Has the emotional depth to break your heart as well as stop it.,1
 It's paced so quickly and is so focused on action that it never really feels quite like Death Note should.,0
" The central concept, that we are watching a community respond to the literalisation of one of its most cherished urban myths, can't quite stand up against the facts of the matter.",1
 This curiosity piece should stimulate interesting conversations about the lessons learned from the viewing experience.,1
" For the guys it's Rodriguez's best film by far and a treat for fans of good-looking girls in black-and-white, of classic film noir and of imaginative ultra-violence.",1
" A sequel (or three-quel, if you will) that returns to the vicarious fun of the first movie, Ocean's Eleven, and all but erases the not-so-fond memory of the preening ego-trip that was Ocean's Twelve.",1
" There's much to like here but it's a bumpy ride and for all its banter, it takes itself very seriously. ",0
" Sometimes -- and far too rarely -- a film will hit all the right notes, with sharp, original dialogue, brilliant casting and an absorbing story. So caught up in its spell, you dread seeing the credits roll. Please Give is that movie.",1
" You would have to smoke a great deal of the stuff to make Pineapple Express seem like a good movie, although from the assorted giggles at the Rio Theatre, the audience was ripped and receptive.",0

 Ralph Breaks the Internet suffers from the same insidious problems that sink almost every internet-related movie.,0
 Forces the square legacy of Cecil into the round 'Forrest Gump' hole.,0
" Horror movies have bad third acts all the time; the hope is that they have two first acts that are this good, with such an excellent anchor as Daniel Kaluuya.",1
" Likely to strike a chord with the turbulent teens Cody captures so well, this vividly lurid tale has cult movie written all over it and may well enjoy a healthy afterlife if it stiffs at the cinema.",1
" This sickly sweet story of an orphan adopted by a billionaire, warming his heart and singing her soul out must have demanded a bit more gee-whiz personality and stagecraft than the young Wallis has in her repertoire yet.",0
 141 minutes of noise and incident.,0
 Zohan is both exponentially stranger than Larry and about twice as amusing.,1

 It's disappointing that such a serious issue and a passionate cry of outrage is cloaked in such a manipulative melodrama.,0
 Capitalism: A Love Story is a Michael Moore movie that Fox News viewers might like.,1
" Stands up extraordinarily well: mostly because of two outstanding central performances, Gary Oldman as the talented, blase Orton, and Alfred Molina as his thwarted, Hancock-esque murderer Kenneth Halliwell.",1
" Released over Super Bowl weekend, it makes perfect sense that Sanctum is horrid. What studio expects anyone to go to the theater on Sunday?",0
" Each story feels unique, yet cut from the same cloth. Here are six tales from the American Frontier, six tales of violence and vengeance, irony and existence, survival and betrayal.",1
" What makes McFarland USA so successful, and so bracing, is the way that its protagonist becomes aware of something that is rarely broached in these sorts of narratives - his own privilege.",1
 ... the grace of movement established goes a long way in showing what is so wrong about the hyperkinetic animation employed in every Marvel Universe film. The Kaiju universe deserved and received more reverence than that ... ,1
" Like the condiment whose name it shares, director Phillip Noyce's run-like-hell thriller starring Angelina Jolie satisfies a basic human taste -- something to go with the popcorn. I liked it. It knows what it's doing.",1
" However suspensefully the score groans and cries, the emotional stakes dwindle with each overemphatic narrative curve.",0
" See No Evil is proficient junk, which makes it something of an improvement over recent horrors like An American Haunting.",0
" A film for people who might call Stalker their favorite movie of all time if only it were more opaque. So, you know, a little audience, but a passionate one.",1
 Perhaps the most emotionally intelligent film you will see this year.,1
 Vallee has crafted a vivid wilderness adventure film that is also a powerful story of family anguish and survival.,1
 Fishing will hook you.,1
" The result is a series of extraneous, deplorably unfunny scenes and sketches stitched together in completely haphazard fashion.",0
" A derivative combination of Seven and Fear Factor, and a work of cynical corporate-style branding posing as independent hustle.",0
 This improbable thriller starts out strong but quickly becomes bogged down in unnecessary plot twists.,0
" Terrifically captivating, whether delivering breathless action, knuckle-whitening suspense or moments of quiet intimacy.",1
" ""Having been so pleasantly surprised by how great Fast 5 was, Fast & Furious 6 is a massively bonkers disappointment.",0

" Mature comedy mixes edgy content, sweet substance.",1
" Neither original nor packed with surprises. It is, however, entertaining and thoroughly likable.",1
" Contains so much crude/sexual humor that they appear to be targeting an audience just a year shy of teenagehood, but the animal antics seem aimed more at the kindergarten set.",0
 An easy and enjoyable way of spending an hour and a half.,1
 Edfeldt and his extraordinary lead actor balance the scales by presenting this tragedy as a test of strength.,1
" Clooney has found a role he fits into so comfortably, that he might be mix his post-Oscar cocktail with two one-ounce bottles of Grey Goose.",1
" [T]his sequel to the 2005 sleeper hit feels like the Teen People version of an old Hollywood ""women's picture,"" the sort of vehicle that kept Joan Blondell and Ann Sothern busy before and during World War II.",1
" Though the impressively-staged action sequences vary in potency, they never bore. That is the job of Spectre's snoozy bad-dude Oberhauser, who spends more time villain-splaining what he might be up to, rather than committing actual acts of villainy.",0
" A sensitive and beautiful film - one that contains genuine insight into the power of human connection, be it romantic, sexual, or some combination of both.",1
" The movie's problem is the division of loyalties between these two female leads, which fatally divides and muddles the dramatic focus.",0
 ... this shrewd set of jabs at American pride and its many prejudices has done its job mighty well.,1
" I felt bad for the cameramen, editors and assistant directors who now must list this vile film on their resumes.",0
" Great cinema it is not, but a mildly enjoyable distraction it most certainly can be, following in a rich tradition of science fiction comedy.",1
" With its propulsive punk-rock soundtrack and beautifully rough cinematography, Dragonslayer makes you care about this scrawny young man, skating to nowhere.",1
" The entire cast of ""The Paperboy"" glistens with a golden sheen, as if they've been sprayed with Pam cooking oil.",0
" A lazy fairy-tale pastiche reveling in mite-size cherubs, which cribs from gnomic mythology, elvish lore, Harry Potter, Arthurian legend and can't-pay-the-rent melodrama.",0
" All the characters get in fights but, SPOILER ALERT, everything ends with hugs, violins, good wishes and warm hearts.",0
 [M]ay be the most repulsive movie I've ever seen... [L]ike the evil Mirror Universe version of Ted.,0
" Jai Gangaajal is crammed with issues such as corporate greed, debt-ridden farms, lawless cities and frustrated civilians, but there's no particular direction to all that chaos.",0
 This is one of those films that you will enjoy with its twists and turns. [Full Review in Spanish],1
" A rich, resonant and deeply textured performance sits at the centre of this Paraguayan feature.",1
" It's unclear as to whether it's the lacklustre acting or mediocre screenplay which is the prevalent downfall within this endeavour, or perhaps it's just a steady combination of the two.",0
" Some welcome skulduggery ensues, but the movie's ultimate agenda of rehabilitating a classic bad guy is a big disappointment.",0
" Watching Mills' film, one wishes it were as weird and wonderful as Irene herself. It's almost as if the writer/director doesn't realize how rare his own creation is.",0
" Oh, the squandering! It's like setting a story on Mars and then pretending we're just out in the Arizona desert.",0
" While watching Miss Sharon Jones!, you might come to think that the film's title is missing a couple of exclamation points.",1
 The thrill of watching Fletcher and Neyman's fray unfold is intensified by Damien Chazelle's attention to the craft and challenge of musicianship.,1
 Ghost Rider is very much a movie for 9 year olds that feels like it was made by a 9 year old. Even 14 or 15 year olds will feel too old for what passes as cool or dark in this edge-of-camp movie.,0
" Dark, dreamlike and dangerous, Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale every bit as scary and moving as they were always meant to be.",1
" For better or worse, it's the kind of feature one can imagine being presented on one side of a DualDisc album edition, if only Sheeran's primary demographic still consumed physical media.",0
" Nichols is paying homage to Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but this work, in its deliberate, character-driven pacing and graceful acknowledgement of invisible worlds parallel to our own, stands in a category by itself.",1
 The story trips over itself at every turn.,0
" What keeps ""Trick"" from attaining its lofty ""Creepshow"" aspirations is the lack of conflict and resolution.",0
" A bold, dark and important chapter in a superhero franchise that continues to evoke the past atrocities of man, in order to portray a fantastic fable of hope amidst hopeless times.",1
" I love Anderson's ambition, but it is awfully hard to make a movie about a culture adrift that doesn't make its audience feel the same. Inherent Vice runs a punishing 148 minutes, not enough of which are funny or sad enough to hold us.",0
 Glossy romance as an angel falls for a surgeon.,1
 director Debra Granik...has created a film rooted in realistic details of wilderness life that's a sympathetic but unsentimental comment on conventional and alternative societies.,1
" It's the stuff of Sunday night TV drama, for winding down with tea and cake. Very civilised.",0
 Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Novitiate is the even-handedness with which it treats religion in general and 1960s era Catholicism in particular.,1
 An oddly charming stoner comedy set in medieval times.,1
" It feels tired, recycled and redundant as it shares many of the same faults that made the second installment a disappointing sequel for those who loved the original.",0
" ""The naked bathhouse fight is perhaps the most eagerly anticipated scene in this brutal Cronenberg thriller - but there's more to it than that.""",1
 The Grand Guignol elements themselves are relatively forced and unconvincing.,0
" Tauntingly slow but hauntingly shot (and edited with crisp abruptness), it was a deserving nominee for Best Foreign Film at last year's Oscars.",1
" It's a bleak but absorbing trip as we creep into the depths of Philip's sad, broken mind. ",1
 Plays too much like an Ayn Rand novel and not enough like October Sky.,0
" With Costner's yokel having a decided preference for being handed a beer rather than a ballot, he does a pretty darn good job of exposing the phony platitudes and pandering of candidates, in a movie about bad news politicians and even badder parenting.",1
 Liam Neeson lends visibility to formulaic human-trafficking action thriller.,0
" While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the ""not for everybody"" critical hedge.",1
" A brisk, well-mounted children's fantasy, with Cornish giving the story an entertainingly apocalyptic spin.",1
" Sensibly dramatising a few representative days rather than Giacometti's whole life, this may seem slight, but there's a lot to dig into here - and Rush hasn't had a showcase this good in years.",1
" An interesting story, but unfortunately, rather uninterestingly told.",0
" The reason the men choose to stay and fight is baffling. Now, if you can get past that tiny issue, the film is not without merit. There is some beautiful cinematography, the acting is brilliant, and the effects are incomparable.",1
" This is your basic, generic sports underdog movie that plays very much like an afterschool special. That's not to say it's all that bad, but one expects more when they're paying ten bucks on a Friday night.",0
 Some filmmakers put feelings into words; Malick uses smoke signals and semaphore to express things felt but unspoken. How you interpret them is up to you.,0
" There's fun to be had viewing this movie, I can't deny that. But this predator is nowhere near apex.",0
" A state-of-the-art multiplex three-ring circus whose special effects stagger the senses and play like a video game, whose human drama aims for the cosmic and lands waist-deep in the Big Silly.",0
" In the end, Neighbors is one of those disappointing comedies that was probably more fun to make than it is to watch.",0
" This umpteenth feature about the unstoppable masked killer Michael Myers could be the work of any journeyman, give or take a few hundred gratuitous pop-culture references.",0
 The problem for filmmakers trying to make this kind of movie is that they are now operating in a post-Wire world.,0
" When the great screen performances of 1988 are considered for Oscar nomination, expect Hoffman's name on the list.",1
 All that inane chatter from Valentina detracts horribly from what is supposed to be going on in a Transporter movie -- mayhem.,0
 Writer-director Daniel Peddle's anthropological concerns never really wed themselves to a sturdy narrative bedrock. ,0
 The film is both overwritten and under-explained. (Full Content Review for Parents also available),0
" As much of a wildman as Philip K. Dick was, it's hard to imagine him being thrilled about his story being turned into a glorified episode of Touched by an Angel.",0
" ... there are some inspired sequences, such as an egomaniac's sword duel from hell... but next time, somebody needs to trim the fat to keep the superspy and his film a little less overindulgent.",1
" For a narrative that deals with the idea of subjective interpretation, Batra's storytelling style is oddly flat and unpoetic.",0
 ... a fun but failed film... [Full review in Spanish],0
" If you ever saw and enjoyed a Freddy or Jason film, this should be a bloody, grotesque delight.",1
 Women have quite a bit more sophistication than what Fogelman's statement allows of us-it's possible to tell an eloquent story of familial history without layering on tragedy in an exploitative fashion.,0
" The action beats, when they hit, are fine but in the end this is only a serviceable thriller that's easily forgettable.",0
" The D Train is a unique adult comedy that features Jack Black and James Marsden pushing their limits as actors into diverse directions, but it's all for naught since it fails to provoke laughter or emotionally move the viewer in the slightest.",0
 Fritz Lang's first noteworthy film is gorgeous to look at and highly imaginative.,1
 Some stylish touches are undone by overwrought genre tropes and an abundance of supernatural nonsense.,0
" It understands the appeal of making strong points in attractive, engaging ways. It's taking lessons from the bad guys, but for the right side.",1
" Strangers gradually pulls you down this discomfiting rabbit hole, and for once even the obligatory re-creations make sense.",1
" [Scorsese's] characters are flawed, horrible, dirty, desecrated; he specialises in the ugly, the weird, the wrong and the wronged... [Silence] is, awkwardly, about ""goodness"" and boringly ""good"" people. ",0
" The movie has two serious flaws ... Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry, is almost devoid of personality ... [and] the film is a full hour too long.",0
" It's a modern-noir portrait of the way we eat our news, but amid the media, Nightcrawler slowly turns its unblinking eye on something darker. And much closer to home.",1
" Pohlad's minimalist-formalist approach to directing - and his desire to not ruin performances with too much cutting - helps sell a screenplay that, in other hands, could have seemed simplistic, even, in its way, traditional.",1
" One of the problems with Ocean's 8 is there isn't a formidable, hiss-worthy villain a la Andy Garcia's casino owner in Oceans 11...there's also something mildly off-putting about the breathless adoration of the Met Gala.",0
" While often hard to watch because of its unflinching portrayal of the ugliness that love can take, Snow Angels succeeds because of the depth of its well-drawn characters.",1
" A vulgar, contrived and weightless romantic comedy.",0
 The series now has the power to deserve comparison to The Lord of the Rings.,1
" Bateman, the director, manages to bring out the two principals' anguish without resorting to sentimentality, until the unsatisfying last quarter of the film when things get gooey.",0
 Heavenly music and compelling commentary from one of the world's foremost violinists who is also a mensch.,1
" If there's one thing more annoying than the dumb mainstream sex comedy, it's the dumb mainstream sex comedy that has aspirations towards indie funk.",0
 Waugh really can direct traffic but he's falls hilariously short when it comes to everything else.,1
" Studded with surreal and unexpectedly tender touches (kamikaze cows, an elegantly lovestruck horse), this is plastic and fantastic.",1
" Bang! Zoom! It's actually pretty funny, but in all the wrong places.",0
" Despite counting on a style that seems overdone, this thriller about the dangers of the internet works. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
" There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about Tomcats, but it's still a fun way to spend 90 minutes -- at least if you enjoy cheap laughs and predictable fluff.",1
" Anyone with an expectation of reality, or an aversion to mawkish melodrama, should probably stay home.",0
" A genuine emotional core at the heart of this glum young outsider's world. Especially as to just how otherworldly adults can seem in a solidly cartoonish universe from the ground up, and all those magnified bulging bellies and backsides surrounding him.",1
" Fourteen-year-old boys will get their money's worth. This boring, preposterous nonsense is stretched to an agonising two-and-a-half hours.",0
 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie mock marriage through star-romance disorder - Hollywood insiders claiming subversive status by assuming they're a joke worth caring about.,0
" Jeff Bridges has never been better than he is here as a coach who uses authority, patience and humor to motivate the gymnasts in his charge.",1

 [Shannon] almost convinces us that the Iceman's humanity was real.,1
" Yes, there is something resembling a traditional climax, but it doesn't come at the expense of the ethereal tone established by Villeneuve. In this time of political upheaval, it's a welcome tonic.",1
" Bigelow has successfully built a vision of war rarely seen on screen, a visceral nearly first person perspective of war where the rush of combat is a welcomed relief.",1
" Writer/director Keith Miller has made a film that never feels forced, never seems artificial. James ""Primo"" Grant is electrifying in the lead role.",1
" Charismatic Jon Hamm is such a good actor that it's a shame his considerable talents are wasted on this frustrating, murky, disjointed political thriller that looks as if it was filmed in a bunker. ",0
" Director Richard Loncraine and writer Joe Forte inject fatty layers of false leads, techno-babble and dull-witted tension into what is essentially a generic hostage machine.",0
 But Arbitrage crackles back to life when Gere is on screen racing around New York City frantically trying to keep his house of cards from collapsing down around him.,1
" Roth is charming and Laurence is an intriguing young talent to watch, but Broken is a shaggy dog story wallowing in emotions that it seldom earns.",0

 A study guide for celebrity bodyguards.,0
 Watts ... delivers one of those tour-de-force deals you often read about but rarely see.,1

 Christopher Robin can't reconcile its darkness and its light.,0
 They're the Powerpuff Girls! And they're here to save the summer from lousy family entertainment.,1
" Another attempt at a charming working-class English comedy in the vein of The Full Monty, this one unfortunately isn't very funny. Finding Your Feet is too maudlin and too long; even the choppy dancing scenes fail to satisfy. ",0
" It's worth a watch thanks to its small pleasures (...) such as the acting, the special effects, and it's thematic content...[Full review in Spanish]",1
" It's doubtful that Vertigo can take equal rank with the best of the Hitchcock studies -- it has too many holes -- but it assays high in visual confectionary of place, person and celluloid wiles.",1
" The slightly glitchy movement of the characters is funny, the animation is awesome, the deconstruction of superheroes is brilliant and the jokes are knowing and slightly edgy.",1
 What emerges is the story of an unstoppable storyteller.,1
" This concentration on the physical quality of sounds is a mesmerizing corroboration of Glennie's belief that tones, timbre, and tempo are in ""everything we see.""",1
 ..this costume drama set in the lull between World Wars is drawn from Julia Strachey's 1932 novella (apparently much-loved by Virginia Woolf) and proves to be almost impossibly English.,0
" The most underrated American director this side of Richard Linklater, Nicole Holofcener, continues to be a master of The Moment: a tiny but meaningful exchange or look or gesture that conveys more emotion than any awards-bait monologue could.",1
" You feel hints of a strange energy in ""Emily"" that remind us we don't always know why we do what we do in relationships. The hard part is holding on for the ride.",1
" [Eastwood] doesn't argue with an empty chair, but he does kick the crap out of a coffee table.",0
" This is a long and dull costume drama that seems to think a contemporary audience can picture faith as easily as it does a cassock, cross or kimono.",0
" Spielberg's E.T., so ugly it was cute, was also full of personality. Echo is adorable and forgettable, and the rest of the characters are simply plot holders in a narrative contraption that generates jeopardy-raising obstacles to Echo going home.",0
 I didn't much care for this very strange movie.,0
" Smart writing, moving performances and of course a lovely soundtrack coalesce into an intimate cinematic gem.",1
" There's a good point to be made about how journalists can be co-opted by access to the powerful people they're supposed to be holding accountable. Unfortunately, Rogen and Goldberg aren't the filmmakers to make this point.",0
 Jasper directs the cast in a way that makes them heart-warming without being sentimental.,1
 SPOILER ALERT: Toby looks like every other horror movie demon. And The Ghost Dimension just looks like every other horror movie.,0
" Parents will feel heard by this movie in a way that few other films have tried. Everyone else should go for the kid, who's a rocket taking off. You want to be able to say you were there when it happened.",1
" It's worthy of an award for ""most acting"", but as for giving the year's best performance, that accolade should be reserved for a performer who disappeared in to their character, instead of merely disappearing into the excessive make-up design.",0
" Beautifully rendered and feels scientifically accurate, but isn't very smart. And without our total buy in, the whole thing feels like a fascinating ""what if"" premise ruined by ""now what"" execution.",0
" The only characters who seem anchored in some form of reality are the hero's parents...all the others, from siblings to servants, are standard-issue eccentrics or the subjects of running gags.",0
" Offers occasional laughs amid a jumble of pop-culture references. Despite its Borat-esque title, don't expect a coherent plot.",0
" Keep it comin', Joss.",1
" Hilary Swank certainly looks the part and...fits the period well, ...but although her Amelia talks about her love of flight, Nair fails to really make us feel it.",0
 There's something thrilling about watching a studio picture that actually expresses a strong political point of view.,1
 See it for the hallucinogenic scenes: real-time acid flashbacks!,1
" Headstrong women might have been hard to find in turn-of-the-century Europe, but heroines like Tautou's are a dime a dozen in costume dramas, and there isn't enough material detailing what makes her Chanel a special case.",0

 There's little in the way of forward momentum until the final 30 minutes; stretching out this picture to longer than two hours was indefensible.,0
 Neither a particularly good movie nor the pop-cultural travesty that some were dreading.,0
 Soderbergh's most ambitious film to date.,1
 The title character of Dagur Kari's debut feature is an albino teenager who lives in a small town in a remote part of Iceland.,0
 Disney sticks to that formula of goofy nonchalance - this time without music,0

 It's rare to see a movie that throws around this much raw emotion and still gets laughs.,1

 There is no life in these scenes-none of the gumption that must have fueled Mary's early decisions.,0
" Like the martial arts masters themselves, the film achieves a seemingly effortless balance.",1
" The period design, covering the 1920s and 30s, is well done and the money was well spent on cars and clothes. But, looks alone do not make a film. It has to have heart, too, and I do not think ""J. Edgar"" has one.",0
" Fans of Evanovich's work should walk away satisfied, perhaps even delighted with the adaptation. Everyone else will simply be able to walk away, which is saying something considering the debilitating toxicity of Heigl's recent output. ",0

 McTiernan does a great job with this submarine thriller. Also features a stellar ensemble of character actors.,1
 ...a pretentious mess...,0
 Flled with so many grandly iconic images that it's rather easy to dismiss the film's not-inconsiderable shortcomings.,1

" Brick is as difficult to categorize as its hard-boiled, made-up lingo is hard to understand -- neither of which should deter anyone from seeing it. It's rare to see a debut as witty and assured as this.",1

 All three of the leads are very good.,1
 A bleak vision of modern Britain that just escapes slipping into a slough of miserabalism by virtue of some light-hearted segments ...,1

" While the ransom paid was the largest ever, the stakes never seem as high as they should be.",0
" Even if you know this history already, A.K.A. Doc Pomus is vital and endearing, a celebration of a great artist, a great character, and the universality of great pop.",1
 A sexy thriller that's got plenty of libido but not nearly as much brains as it thinks it has.,0
" A group of benevolent, joyful creatures willingly dedicate their lives to serving the worst forms of life on the planet: that is a terrible concept for a comedy.",0
" Leilo's film is warm and contemplative rather than cold and clinical, with light doses of magical realism and a marvelous lead performance from Vega.",1
" The Sixth Sense will convince you that spooky movies can be exciting, chilling, mysterious, and rewarding.",1
" Ultimately the, yes, snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary, like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok.",0
" Fincher's visual mastery and Pitt's charisma almost compensate for a gimmick in search of a meaning. The more time Fincher gives viewers with Button, the thinner the character grows.",0
" A great play made into a dreary, over-indulgent movie.",0
" McKinney is no Robert McNamara, but there are lessons to be learned from this fog of sleaze.",1
 An eerie and unsettling adaptation of Judy Pascoe's novel that impresses more for its atmospherics than its narrative.,1

" Crossing Over 'Crashes' the gates of illegal immigration with little new, or insightful, to add to the debate.",0
" The sharp modern choreography is entrancing and adds a physicality to the magic that gave it impact, even more so than in the original.",1

 Director David Gordon Green foregoes any pumped-up melodramatics and simply allows Gyllenhaal and Maslany to provide the story with the honest emotion it requires.,1

 The best of intentions are buried in blatantly manipulative appeals to tradition.,0

 Hard to watch but hard to let go. This is a great document on reality. [Full review in Spanish].,1
" Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books, they can't go wrong. Better effects, better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh. An excellent sequel.",1
" With its slapstick car wrecks and sports injuries, the movie is like a Michael Bay take on Garden State. It wants to be painfully funny, but it really is just plain painful to watch.",0
" Burning turns into a frightening experience, almost like a Hitchcockian thriller. A true delight. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
 Surely a better title would have been 'Saturday'.,0

 too lame to tempt tweenagers looking for the next cool thing at the cinema.,0
 A heartbreakingly powerful masterpiece that affected me far more deeply than any other film I've seen all year.,1

 The film feels just a few degrees left of sanity.,0
 Whit Stillman? I'm there.,1
" [It's] blatantly offensive-racist, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, ugly, repugnant, vulgar, etc., unapologetically so -- but takes full responsibility for everything that it is, everything that battle rap is, with the delicacy of a wet fart.",1
" It's an interesting premise but sadly, Bel Ami is a film that underachieves. I found it a continual struggle to understand the mindset of each character.",0
" Chloe descends into a preposterous third act that, by any measure, qualifies as a disaster. But it's proof of Egoyan's skill that the film works for as long as it does.",0
" The movie is a pleasant way to spend time in the dark, especially for Francophiles, but it won't leave any lasting impression.",0
" ""Samsara"" is a magical and lyrical film that lingers on its beautiful (and, sometimes, not-so-beautiful) imagery of places that few will ever get to see - save for here.",1
" Falk and Rowlands -- in performances of almost indescribable intensity -- detail a marriage anchored by love, but tossed by the expectations of others and the unpredictable swell of madness.",1
" [An] increasingly rare cinema experience - a film that excites the senses, calms the heart, and stays with you for a long time afterwards. One to savour.",1
" It's an insult, not just to war veterans, but to the audience.",0
 Inevitability of the plotting and lack of modulated rhythm make the 97-minute running time feel longer than it is.,0

" Visually, Grant Major's production design and the CGI effects are amazing.",1
" Horrible Bosses is no masterpiece, but it's a solid comedy with great chemistry.",1
" The stars? Well, while I'm sure they had fun phoning in their performances - I hope they've destroyed the records - I can't help wishing they were all doing something more interesting.",0
" Unwilling to settle on one climax to his lumbering narrative, Polanski seems to have included them all.",0
" If positive thinking results in computer-animated body cells farting or singing Robert Palmer, our chi, mojo, or whatever has miles to go toward self-actualization.",0
" Rich in compassion, humor and complexity, All About My Mother not only brings its central characters from darkness to light, it suggests a brighter future for the bedraggled art of cinema.",1
" It really had everything you want...some of the scenes were seriously incredibly cool to watch, and Lara Croft is a fierce woman.",1
" The Other Boleyn Girl is an agreeable piece of filmmaking, carefully and sometimes artfully balancing solemnity with fluff.",1
" Zandvliet isn't above a few unnecessarily manipulative moments, but he handles intense drama with confidence, delivering a WWII saga that's engrossing and harrowing.",1
" Insurrection isn't nearly as good as First Contact. But is a far cry from the first of the Next Generation movie adventure, Generations.",1
 All the elements will be represented here as metaphor for the completeness of their bond. It's not subtle. Now's not the time for subtlety.,1
" Dillon might have trouble putting this one at the top of his resume if he wants to do a Disney film, but there's no question he delivers an impactful movie monster, with darting eyes and a toothy smile that makes Jack at once seem empathetic and bonkers.",1
" [H]alf good and half bad, and the primary dividing line is by genus. ",0
" Haneke doesn't offer easy solutions or pat emotions. He merely offers us a chance to eavesdrop and holds a mirror up to our own fears of old age, hopes for love, and challenges through life.",1
" Woody Allen, in his thirtieth outing as writer-director, still shows signs of change, improvement, depth of feeling.",1

" A beautifully crafted, slow-burn crime saga steeped in native traditions.",1
 The movie is filled with such high spirits and good humor that the jokes are pointed but not barbed.,1
" A haunting, atmospheric film that focuses on a young girl's obsession with the Frankenstein monster.",1
 Idolization doesn't make for particularly compelling entertainment.,0
 Wright's direction and the highly literary adaption of Ian McEwan's award-winning novel by Christopher Hampton give this story an epic sweep.,1
" So restrained that it often comes off as coldly technical, Beast is most engaging when it lets loose and embraces Moll's feverishness.",0
" ""Coco"" doesn't fully scale the heights of its predecessors, but where it counts, the movie hits almost all the right notes.",1
 It's about time for Cedric the Entertainer to change his name.,0
 Worth a look? Rather.,1
 The most shocking thing about Down to Earth is how limp and mild it really is.,0

" By the beard of Zeus! Brett Ratner delivers fast, fun thrills to score a sound victory over Renny Harlin's laborious The Legend Of Hercules.",1
" The Oscar-nominated film may feature thoughtful material and some strong performances, but it starts so slowly and perplexingly that it may lull others to sleep.",0
" Tulip Fever is neither good nor terrible. It's just mediocre, jumbled, and neither serious enough for history nor fun enough for trash",0
" Provocative, accessible and refreshingly fair and balanced.",1
" Bleakly enigmatic about the motives of its psychotic protagonist, ""Simon Killer"" gets cozy with one man's pathological rage.",1
 Spirals to an unconvincing climax that rather undoes the good work that has gone before.,0
 Dolly's always been a woman full of contradictions. Her honesty is coated with a thick layer of glam. Dumplin' is sort of a mess of these contradictions too. ,1
" ""All I See Is You"" is halfway through before something resembling a plot kicks in, and even then this limp, shape-shifting psychodrama proves unable to sell it with anything approaching coherence.",0
" For those still mourning the end of the Twilight series, here's something to get you back on your feet - another supernatural teen love story, with witches and warlocks replacing vampires and werewolves.",1
" Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex, generous and subversive artworks of the last decade.",1
" The young cast of Xers are all pretty good and some of the action scenes are expensively impressive, and yet this feels a little strained and overly familiar at times.",1
" ...an awkward amalgamation of well played characters working with wildly uneven material that references newer films like ""Point Break"" and ""Entrapment"" as much as the original series.",0
" Clever, fast-paced and kid-friendly, ""Meet the Robinsons"" if you want an enjoyable family outing.",1
" A stylish, sexy, quintessentially-60s spy thriller that puts 'fun' at the top of its hit list",1
" Writer-director Alain Guiraudie gives the proceedings an almost clinical detachment, and consequently ""Stranger by the Lake"" has an air of Hitchcock to it.",1
" Carax's film is a cousin to ""Synecdoche"" and a modern response to Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" He even appears to have anticipated Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis,"" answering the questions set forth...as to where all the limos go at night.",1
" Anyone uninitiated with Rob Zombie's brand of grainy hillbilly brutality would be better served by eating a bran muffin and steering clear of this particular horror film, because it's a compliment to call it a piece of crap.",0
 Hysteria might be the most unlikely romantic comedy of the year -- if not the decade.,1
" Teller is, by far, the best thing about this easygoing, stubbornly generic independent romance from Max Nichols.",0
" It's ultimately a pretty sad story, and definitely not a flattering one.",1
" Emma Roberts and Dave Franco are just fine, but there's no huge onscreen spark between them. Most of the supporting roles are thinly drawn and forgettable.",0
 It's no small feat for the audacity of I Declare War's premise - presenting an afterschool game of war in a way that looks and feels as real to viewers as it does to the youngsters in the thick of it - to be matched by the cunning of its execution,1
" There's very little about hiking in this movie, but you do get to see Nick Nolte stuffing pancakes into his stupid face. ",0
 Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's passion for her devout Sufi Muslim subject blinds her to a need for shaping a coherent story in a puffy documentary that goes slack with gooey adulation more often than not.,1
 What Marina sees in Borgman is one of the countless implausibilities that make the film more annoying than disturbing.,0
 All sorts of talent has been chucked away here by the director's heavy touch and the script's naked contrivance.,0
" Welcome to Dark Crimes, a movie that boldly sets itself a number of obstacles to overcome, beginning with two big ones: the writing and the directing.",0
" While there's not much to it, the actors have plenty of grist to bring their roles to life. Which makes the film funny and intense all the way through, even if there's no emotional connection at all.",1
 Here's a movie with an origin that's almost more interesting than that of its 'Astro Boy' hero,1
" Money might buy bigger toys, but it can never replace heart, and that is something this terrific comedy has in abundance.",1
" That Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars can prop up what is essentially half an epic and have us say ""more please"" is testament to their talents and that of director Francis Lawrence",1
" Star-producer Warren Beatty takes a stereotypically gay character, a glamorous hairdresser, and turns it into a womanizer in Beverly Hills, which is sort of Our Town, suburbia as small-town America, only four decades later.",1
" A Secret takes the tired approach of a child viewing history through the quirks of his family, which worked only slightly better in last year's Blame it On Fidel.",0
" Uncle Boonmee is a delightfully original, if not entirely explicable, story of a dying Buddhist man's journey into the jungle.",1
" Prisoners is, first and foremost, a crime drama in which Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski slowly ratchet the suspense by making the audience privy to clues the characters do not have the opportunity to put together.",1
" There are way too many characters to keep track of, they're too cartoonish to care about, and the plot is madly baroque in a most wearisome way.",0
 Lumbers like a Cadillac with a flat tire stuck in first gear.,0
 Warning: The bassline Ron Carter contrived for the classic cut 'Buggin' Out' is about as easy to dislodge from your brain as a 'Night Gallery' earwig.,1
 Margot comes across as such an elusive and unsympathetic twit that you wonder why we should care about her.,0
" The sad thing is, there's a perfectly fine, Sam Fulle-rish, 90-minute war movie on a worthy subject trapped somewhere in the self-indulgences of Miracle at St. Anna.",0
" Ralph Breaks the Internet, a more complete film with a bigger and more evolved story to share, doesn't need parlor tricks to keep viewer interest.",1
 The film lacks consistency in both charm and script quality.,0
" Bad things happen and terrible choices are made in the very sad, very nerve-racking, very good melodrama Reservation Road.",1
" It's not that Hellboy II is a particularly bad sequel, but that it tries to do way too much in the time allotted.",1
 Some lush period imagery and expressive performances by the young leads can't compensate for a gloomy and pretentious screenplay that lacks sufficient narrative momentum to generate emotional investment,0
" So forgettable that I'm almost happy Fox Searchlight held the film back for week-of-release screenings because if I saw this awhile ago, I wouldn't remember enough about it to write a review.",0
" This new feature takes issues of absurdity and scale to heart in many ways; it is modest as well as ambitious, and its title character is played by Paul Rudd, the most appealingly self-deprecating of actors.",1
 Watson meanwhile continues to search for a role that deserves her talent and growing maturity; her determination in Colonia is clear and yet misplaced. And that's unfortunately also the case with the entire film.,0
" You're Spider-Man, not Dawson Leery.",0
 The special effects simply thrust Ultraviolet in an Xbox 360 for action set-pieces that are kinetic and colorful but surprisingly unexciting. Do we really care if she dies when she's just going to be regenerated anyway?,0
 A battle to sit through.,0
" The film that follows is thin and frothy, though watch out for that final sentimental upsurge. It could drag and lift you against your will.",0
" Leung turns in his usual fine performance, and Tang shows evidence of the kind of chops that will guarantee her a long career. Maybe her next film will tell a better story.",0
" It'll remind you of 50 other films at least, from The Fifth Element to Blade Runner, and for anyone unlucky enough to have seen it, the crashingly tedious Total Recall remake.",0
" It contextualizes cinema not only as a form of magic (capable of transformative, elated power), but also of revolution.",1
 Sherlock Holmes is neither a cookie-cutter blockbuster nor insulting to the source material.,1
" The performances are solid, with a special nod to the droll buffoonery of Zach Gilifianakis, whose character is out of it even when he is sober and alert.",1
" Chazelle's plot twists grow increasingly ridiculous, prizing intensity over credibility, and the final act has the feel of a fever dream. I just couldn't go with it.",0
 'The Bay' goes that little extra step from being just another gross-out horror pic.,1
 A two-and-a-half-hour cinematic mosaic meant by Malick more as a monument to himself than to the misrepresented maiden it presumes to memorialize.,0

 Tepid and only sporadically amusing.,0

 Inspiration is the life-affirming theme of this charming story in which a fencer in Soviet occupied Estonia inspires the children he teaches to learn a new skill and face new challenges,1
" Not only is Stifler taking over this [movie], he's also engaging in one ridiculous experience after another, most of them humiliating.",0
 A pretentious and self-absorbed chamber piece that underscores the importance of the 1968 student riots in Paris.,0
 A spiritual masterwork about the harm that can be done with cruel and dehumanizing words. ,1
" The cinematic equivalent of a waving white flag, finally surrendering to the judgment of curious filmgoers who've been waiting a long time for this dud.",0
" The International almost seems like a Monty Python spoof on spy-game thrillers in which the phrase 'secret agent' is constantly replaced by 'banker,' resulting in lines like, '...If I die, 100 other bankers take my place.'",0
" The intimacy Ford develops is rare and transfixing. Strong Island is as much an exploration of the filmmaker's identity and feelings surrounding his brother's murder as it is a loving, even-handed portrait of William.",1
" Even if Cain and co-screenwriter Carole Whang Schutter hold no animosity toward the LDS, the flat-footed fakiness of their story prevents September Dawn from feeling historically accurate.",0
" If you can ignore the tiresome romance and the incessant playing of largely inane music on the soundtrack, Grosse Point Blank has much to recommend it.",0
" He's Big, He's Green, He's Back, He's Not That Entertaining.",0
 This one is for the fans.,1
" Far from a perfect film, but it is a lot of fun. In the tradition of old-fashioned thrillers, the movie has some nice twists and turns in the plot. ",1
" Places a huge burden on [Aaron] Johnson, who has to play an icon in his pre-icon days while holding down the center of a family drama about a boy with abandonment issues.",1
" Here is a $150 million sequel in which bigness reigns supreme, and the characters are subservient to the tech. Watching this movie is to see a cinematic future in which the flesh and blood of human drama means very little.",0
 A horror franchise isn't born.,0
 It's about time a movie about a real person dared to process its influential subject's vision and take a chance.,1
" Our basic love of these characters in such an even distribution of involvement and grand context of good vs evil make for maximum enjoyment of a terrific script carried out with conceptual proficiency and, even, sensitivity.",1
" Though the film benefits from an easy chemistry between the leads, it never hits any of the highs hinted at early on, leaving audiences unfulfilled by the possibility of what might have been.",0
" There's an impressive, lived-in authenticity about the movie, but it's bogged down by heavy-handed symbolism, rote storytelling and zero female characters of note (sorry Zoe Saldana). Well-made, but why?",0

 Salt proves Jolie has what it takes to stand in the spotlight as a prominent female action star.,1
" The film is just a stunt or, more specifically, a calling card, but that might be enough for anyone who's ever wanted to kick Mickey Mouse square in his padded, pious balls.",1
" If I were to say that I can introduce you to a 90-year-old woman who you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off of, you might not believe me until you see Iris Apfel.",1
" An anime body-switch comedy that evolves into a surprisingly moving, edge-of-your-seat thriller. ",1
" It's one of Cronenberg's more complex relationship tales, that puts a deadly spin on separation, loss and hopeless love.",1
" ""Limitless"" delivers the goods in terms of fun, suspense, and an above-average story. The twists and turns never appear without reason, and Cooper delivers an assured, charismatic performance that lifts the film.",1
" While better than it should be, if you listen hard enough you can actually hear a barrel being scraped between the gags.",1
 This is one of those films where not much happens at a very slow pace. There is some nice scenery in the film. It looks like a good vacation spot. The film? Not much to it.,0
" The story unfolds in a choppy flashback structure that robs the story of any momentum, there's never a strong emotional connection to the characters and each clumsy plot dump contradicts the previous clumsy plot dump.",0
 It's heretical but true: I prefer my Farrelys sentimental.,1
" 'Tammy' is a disappointment, because it asks an energetic, unpredictable performer to play it so calculatingly, frustratingly safe.",0
" ""Infamous""' powerhouse casting doesn't add much, since most of the big names -- Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis, Juliet Stevenson, and director Peter Bogdanovich -- serve as little more than window dressing.",0
 Alfredson excels at bringing out the best from his cast and foregrounding their convincing portrayals while seamlessly slipping in several valuable flashbacks.,1
 Never has the tragedy of 9/11 been made so shrinky-dinked.,0
" This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart. When you think about it, that's pretty exciting. And it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward.",1
 A clanging approximation of fun.,0
" The TV host and podcaster has always been skilled at finding the comic absurdity in darkness, but it's the moving way he talks about searching for hope that really makes this hour resonate.",1
" Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesn't make this silly endeavour worthwhile.",0
" While the story of stars aligning and destinies repeating themselves and overlapping is appealing, in this story they align a little too neatly, leaving you less wonderstruck and more dumbfounded as to the story's credibility.",0
" Like its eponymous protagonist, Terri sits awkwardly outside mainstream expectations, but is all the more appealing for it.",1
" 'The Vow' is inspired by a true and wonderful story, but that doesn't make the fictionalized version any less ridiculous.",0
" Unfortunately, the film squanders the talents of its cast on a poor script that's bogged down with poor jokes, underdeveloped characters, and a juvenile approach to feminism that doesn't advance the conversation.",0
" Miranda July's rejection of traditional storytelling is valuable, but the common complaints that her work is mannered or twee are accurate.",0
" Would be a prominent piece of low-budget filmmaking if had appeared a decade or so ago, but by now the genre is so tired, the glorification of violent criminals so prosaic, that it rates simply as an also-ran.",0
" It's both preposterous and horrific, and therein lies its powerful, disquieting charm.",1
" Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie. ",0
 Real-life brothers Nat and Alex Wolff are squabbling siblings in this weak rom-com.,0

" Fuqua delivers a very reserved product, without being risky both in the plot and in its development, and this ends up taking its toll. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
" It conjures up several good ideas and a few good scenes, but nothing ties them together except an equal number of bad scenes and misshapen ideas.",0
" This is an old-fashioned mess with flashes of potential: Rebecca Hall's ""lady doctor"", as hubristic a medic as any of her male colleagues, is clever. And in a film that is mostly an embarrassment, its supporting cast is mostly an embarrassment of riches.",0

 It makes less sense than any preceding Nightmare film...although it's so out-and-out crazy that it's at least a little bit more entertaining than some of them,0
" Appaloosa is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological duel.",1

 It is a pity that Pawlikowski abandons his quietly haunting impressionism in the film's more literal second half.,0
" A film about the joy of being young and a little bit crazy, ruled by the organizing principle of all Zemeckis and Gale's early work: barely controlled chaos. ",1
 THE PERFECTION's playfulness and body horror anchor an uncommon film into some incredibly entertaining waters. A strong stomach and good humor will be rewarded kindly by this one.,1

" This mindless, soulless sequel is sensory overload with barely a story, but it will still manage to please the teenage male demographic with constant, if confusing action.",0
" It's funny throughout - not to say that it inspires many laughs, but it's full of irony and absurdity and is very smart.",1
" Stoker is a movie about tension and inaction, about people trying to figure out what's going on in someone else's head.",1
" I wouldn't lose a minute of At Berkeley. If anything, it made me wish Wiseman had a weekly TV show that monitored the daily life of my alma mater.",1
" The film is a decent trip back into the world of magic, but it isn't a strong film on its own.",1
" It almost seems like a failed TV pilot where they were planning to tell some really cool stories in the first season, but they never ended up writing those episodes.",0
 Thor...as in bore? Bingo.,0
" A film that combines humor, kindness, adventure, fighting and a message about love. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Pacific Rim is what every summer blockbuster should be: loud, ridiculous fun, but with thought and effort behind all the special effects.",1
 We're well beyond the realms of good and bad with this material.,0
" Has lost little of the maddening, bewildering weirdness that made it a seminal midnight-movie phenomenon.",1
 Michael Keaton and Christian Bale are the best. George Clooney and Ben Affleck are among the worst. But Will Arnett is by far the funniest.,1
" The cinematic equivalent of Brussels sprouts; parents will drag their kids to see it whether they want to go or not, and it's bound to leave an unpleasant aftertaste in the mouths of all ages.",0
" It all happens about 100 times faster than the original Star Wars while taking itself about 1,000 times less seriously than the Star Wars prequels.",1
" It's too early to tell whether movie comedies will be the right forte for Chris O'Donnell, but The Bachelor suggests that he might not want to eliminate his other acting options just yet.",0
 We could have had something really representing the vibrant Aussie film industry.,0
" Jerry and Sam are essentially one-dimensional cartoon characters, and having powerhouses like Roberts and Pitt play them is a case of overkill.",0
 Vicky Jewson has an aptitude for punchy action setpieces... and it's a shame that the script she wrote with producer Rupert Whitaker doesn't support it with an equally strong narrative.,0
" This is a deeply cynical movie, with not much to say but a lot to feel.",1
" The Mule, much like The Old Man & the Gun, is a pleasant film, it's an entertaining film, but it's not a riveting or thrilling film.",1
" David Lowery's A Ghost Story is an ambitious tale filled with gorgeous imagery and pieces of an intriguing narrative, but the film is ultimately let down by its lack of substance, which leaves you with a beautiful, yet somewhat forgettable, experience.",0
" Life Itself celebrates the human condition and all of its complications with humuor, poignancy and love.",1
" Retaining much of the classic story elements allows the viewer to focus on the intricate details in the set design, costumes and art direction.",1
" This singular man is all of the iconic actor/director's signature roles compiled over the decades all rolled into one, the ghosts of each and every one of them hovering over the film like Marley haunting Scrooge.",1
" Tallied up, while there are a few flashes of decent writing and some solid acting from the supporting cast, 'Nowhere Boy' lacks any cohesive tempo...",0
 Gupta's faithfully muted approach to Sheers' literary atmosphere is both Resistance's illusive strength and its hindrance.,1
" It's beyond dispute that it takes talent to make a film this acutely, relentlessly distressing. Why anyone would want to put themselves through such an ordeal, however, is a much more equivocal matter.",0
 Impressive production values but muddled impact.,0
" If you can hang on for close to two hours with almost no resolution, it's worth the ride.",1
" An important story, powerfully told but problematic at the same time. Worth watching? Definitely.",1
 TCCOBB is monumentally impressive. Three hours of pure screen magic.,1
" It's very genteel, and the ingenious skits of Paddington and the Brown family celebrate the essential inventiveness and eccentricity at the heart of the British sensibility. ",1
" Franklin is noted for his forays into the underbelly of brutality and betrayal, and his 1992 cult favorite, One False Move, is a perfect example of his ability to mine the essence of the genre.",1
" It's easy enough to explain what Hold the Dark is about ... As for what the movie is About, that's much more difficult to deduce.",0
 What's truly frightening about Scary Movie is that parts of it are actually funny.,1
" What in the world can you say about this? The purest, funniest and most endearing Muppet flick--it's simply the pinnacle of extant evidence we have to the genius of Henson and those he surrounded himself with. Highly recommended.",1
" There comes a point where you can't decide whether you're bored or nauseous, or a little bit of both.",0
" Australia, set in Australia's Northern Territory, a land of romance and adventure, should have been a terrific epic, but instead is a lavish family time-killer.",0
" If Toback and Baldwin set out to prove that nobody is making good movies any more, then this utterly inept piece of filmmaking should prove just the ticket.",0
" For the film's many sins, Personal Shopper is surprisingly effective and intermittently gripping. For that, credit is due to a truly phenomenal performance from Stewart.",0
" Here's the biggest story of our time, lucidly told.",1
" Once the bizarre complaints of the easily offended have died down, I don't doubt that this'll find a place amongst Scorsese's best work.",1
" ... Plays as a thriller, even though the ""action"" consists only of people reading, talking and typing.",1
" Savage Grace has been shot with decadent cool creaminess, yet it's a rather slipshod movie.",1
 A fat suit with a paper-thin plot does not a movie make.,0
" Clint Eastwood's The 15:17 to Paris takes a taut, engrossing, and surprising nonfiction book-the most complete and genuine account of an act of real-life heroism that enthralled the whole free world-and turns it into a flaccid, bewildering docudrama.",0
" Snakes on a Plane has an irresistible title and an impressive promotional campaign -- but pitches aren't plots, and marketing isn't moviemaking.",0
 One continues to long for the days when McClane was just a cop on vacation and his smirk was just one of his weapons and not the entire arsenal.,0
" In the absence of any apparent formal conceit, Barnard's parable is still raw enough to wound while its emotional impact could wring tears from metal.",1
" Thankfully, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man is as engaging as ever. He almost single-handedly saves this sequel, which is genial enough but not nearly as much fun as the original.",1
" [Craig's] skillfully wrapped up and delivered [Spectre] at my feet just in time for Christmas. Sure, there might be a few too many layers of paper and way too much tape, but it's the gift I wanted regardless.",1
" If you like Adam Sandler, goofy comedy and football, I suggest seeing The Waterboy instead.",0
" Ghost Town is a fantasy charmer, from its tight cast and excellent soundtrack to its complex characters and soulful climax.",1
 Michael Moore takes on U.S. Healthcare (or lack thereof) in this impassioned plea for change.,1
" If Killing was a cleverer film and perhaps a more ""informative"" one (if you want to learn about the Indonesian killings, at least), then Silence is a more gut-wrenching one.",1
" Once upon a time, horror pictures like this one played urban grind houses and starred the B-movie likes of Wings Hauser. The gloss of A-list casting and slicked-up production values doesn't necessarily serve them well.",0
" This somewhat lowbrow fantasy spoof simply repeats the same jokes -- once, twice, three times ... or more.",0
 It's not a wreck of a movie; it's not a sleek race car either. But there's heat to be felt here.,1
 Lighthearted fare with a provocative edge.,1
" Another heavily weighted, often histrionic effort from writer/director Oren Moverman and actor Woody Harrelson, 'Rampart' gives Harrelson plenty of opportunity to chew the bark off the palm trees in Los Angeles.",0
" Ocean City, the New Jersey town battered by Hurricane Sandy, certainly didn't need the drab, unfunny ""Girl Most Likely"" invading its shores.",0
 It's Rob Schneider who had something better to do!!!! I have to refer to him forever from this day forward as The Smart One.,0
 Has some original moments but overall it fails to impress.,0
 an overlong exercise that fails to pay off,0
 What could have been a smart comedy about the battle of the ages too often finds itself in such a loss for anything funny that it resorts to an endless string of jokes about male sex organs.,0
 Anderson has efficiently sabotaged and humiliated himself.,0
" In Summer of Sam, Spike Lee isn't interested in truth - or coherence, for that matter.",0
 Shows typical insight into the awkward years.,1
" A bad movie that could work for fans of the series, but that's it. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" Mr. Gyllenhaal's strong performance still doesn't add enough substance to a film that is hollow at the center. It's mostly the fault of Mr. Sipe, who seems to believe that saying nothing is saying something.",0
" Comes equipped with a convoluted narrative that weaves in and out of a myriad of stories, and suffers in the same way ensemble features tend to - as a film with a distinct lack of focus.",0
" It would be hard for any fictional treatment to beat the pleasures of Osmond's genial, enthralling documentary.",1
 It's the quieter moments where Oyelowo really excels.,1
" The script does not wear so well, dragging along for stretches. Reeves, in his usual sullen delivery way, does not help take up the slack.",0

" The ham-handed director was Susanna White, who intercuts compulsively, whether or not anything is happening.",0
" Throughout Alex and Benjamin Brewer's film, Nicolas Cage holds the screen with his distinct timing and expressive force of being.",1
 Only during a face-off between the knights and Saxons on a frozen lake does the film approach anything resembling excitement.,0
" Somewhere around the middle, Nispel can't raise the bar any higher. His brutal set pieces become predictable, his interesting character sketches reveal their limitations, and the film runs out of fuel.",0
" Once you get past the staggering question of who gave this thing the green light, Gigli actually turns into a uniquely bad movie that yields real (albeit unintentional) laughter.",0
" Much of the reason Wolverine has become everyone's favorite Canadian mutant is because, despite his origins in the Marvel Universe, he doesn't act much like a superhero.",1
 She's Out of My League is a rowdy blast because the spiky young cast treats the played-out script like virgin territory. That's acting!,1
 2.0 is a very clever spectacle not to be missed for its sheer audacity and scale.,1
 [Both] a glorious celebration of the lunatic fringe (led by wild-child Doug Kenney) and a cautionary tale of the destructive impact of fame and fortune.,1
" The first Bond is still one of the best Bonds, though modern audiences won't be wowed by the gadgetry that has become accelerated over the years.",1
" Brynych draws upon German Expressionist film techniques, blending both Hollywood noir and classic horror film styles.",1
" A sweet love story gets sabotaged by an action film with way too many shots fired, far too many vehicles blown up.",0
 Gorgeous to look at and lightweight fun while it lasts.,1
" During the course of this second night out, Ranjan's series reveals its true colours: those of a genial narcissist whose superficial charm wears off very quickly. Swipe left.",0
 To describe what's wrong with this perfectly serviceable pulp scenario requires only one word: everything.,0
" Though competently acted and lushly upholstered, this childish film is let down by bold-type irony: so bludgeoning that it ceases to merit the description. ",0
" Despite some imaginative designs, The Haunted Mansion just sort of lies there, as if -- like some of its characters -- it is waiting to be roused from eternal slumber.",0
" Thor is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman and, as with The Man of Steel, it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible.",0
 Need for Speed feels like the snuff film of racing movies.,0
" Butler charges around, flexing his muscles and growling, maybe throwing in a few snarls and snorts, and he's nothing but boring. He's the best thing in the movie.",0
" Ultimately, none of this comes together in any coherent way, truly leaving audiences with an experience that lives and dies based on the craft of bloodshed and gore",0
" Though not a great documentary and essentially a colorful, 3D commercial for Electric Daisy Carnival, it works as both an introduction to a subculture many may be unfamiliar with and as a beat-heavy scrapbook for those who were there.",1
" ""Neon Bull"" is a profound reflection on the intersection of the human and bestial.",1
 Once again Tom Hanks shows the depths of his talent.,1
" Cruise is terrific and entertaining, freewheeling and funny, and many years into his career, he still carries himself like one of Hollywood's top guns.",1
" A small-scale family drama that walks the walk, but doesn't seem to know where it's going half the time.",0
 Nothing much...what once might have seemed witty and sophisticated now comes across as tired and recycled.,0
 While John Carter never completely solves its numerous problems...it does provide several sequences of rousing sci-fi spectacle.,1
" ...a dull, thoroughly unpleasant horror flick...",0
" Debbie Doebereiner ... is a revelation, creating a character that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has ever held down a low-level job.",1
" As animation, this is top class, and a mile away from the orthodox. Some of the detail is terrific, and the screenplay is sharply intelligent.",1
" ""Uncle Drew"" may be tired, but it shows that one's fundamental love for the game never gets old.",0
" The film's animation is very colorful and imaginative, reflecting the original artwork of Theodor Seuss Geisel. Although there is a definite environmental message in the film, it is also a story of empowerment.",1
" When the sex and weirdness stops, all we're left with is pseudo-intellectual discussions from this trio that is found in every dorm across America.",0
" Gladiator is a movie that while watching, you can enjoy; for a while.",0
" An episode of ""The Ultimate Fighter"" has more variation and better lines, too.",0
 The third time around for The Fast and the Furious finds the franchise spinning its tires.,0
 It's easy to admire what Shyamalan is trying to do here; it's just tough to argue that he succeeds.,0
" It's a happy and welcome debut, showing not only a genuine sense of humour and technical brilliance, but a clever ability to combine serious themes with family entertainment.",1
 There are too few instances where all of the film's different elements come together to deliver any kind of visceral charge.,0
 Fighting With My Family ultimately reveals itself as a shallow take on a genuinely fascinating story.,0
" It is not merely an antiwar document, but a complex profile in courage of a paraplegic and patriot.",1
 A simple and endlessly charming look at a weekend in the life of an uncomplicated middle-aged man living with his aging mama.,1
 Troy's sword-and-sandal spectacle is tempered by the human drama of men who fight to protect their homes or for their honor or to gain immortality and glory through deeds. ,1
 Disney/Pixar's Up is a triumphant masterstroke for the studio and their Teflon reputation.,1
 The whole thing's about as enjoyable as a holiday to Guantanamo Bay. Less a movie and more a two-hour finger wag.,0
" Even ace editor Walter Murch struggles to give coherence to the professor's fractured, episodic journey through darkening wartime exile in Geneva, to the brighter revelations of '50s India and the sun-kissed Mediterranean.",0
" Except for Jessica Lange's silent, expressive close-ups, the women's journey in Bonneville is aesthetically and dramatically unremarkable.",1
" The movie's supporting stars are always, inevitably, winking at the audience, but it's unclear whether the dewy-eyed leads even know how to blink. ",0
 Kind of sucks. And not in a good way.,0
" By pandering to the Avatar market's debased taste and indifference to storytelling details, this technically polished, emotionally crude remake sets back the advances that once had been made in horror movies.",0
" When all is said and done, and Cloverfield plays out, we're left with...'a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'",0
" The torpid first half nearly made me drift into suspended animation. But the exciting second half makes up for it with a long, thrilling, Pyrrhic battle.",1
" One of the effects of Harmony Korine's feverish, hypnotic style is that the whole thing feels like a fantasy--or rather a nightmare perversion of the American dream.",1
" Running a painfully long 100 minutes, the movie is made up of a tiresome series of predicable, slapstick moments.",0
" The movie tries to do for amateur cooking contests what ""Best in Show"" did for dog competitions, but the strained folksiness and tired stereotypes couldn't be further from the snap and wit of prime Christopher Guest.",0
" As sunglasses and guitar picks fly...and mics and pointing drumsticks thrust out of the screen, it's a sort of metaphor for the whole film (and the band it captures) to ponder which effects are ""real"" and which are manufactured in a computer. [Blu-ray]",0
 It gives a big-screen face to an American culture generally relegated to the margins of mainstream movies. Too bad it belabors as many stereotypes as it challenges. ,0
 The film looks beautiful but is deeply unpleasant to watch.,0
" Even if this isn't an entirely inventive approach to an oral history of a failed experiment, Too Funny to Fail touches on a profound idea that runs through popular mainstream artistic pursuits. ",1
 The characters have the depth of an algae pool.,0
 The film has a compassion for its subjects and shines a light on the small things that are so often left out of these kinds of stories.,1
" The result is an episodic, generous-spirited, pristinely shot and, quite frankly, somewhat dull effort.",0
 Boring mess of an aimless movie in which Farmiga shows no aptitude for directing. ,0
 It's a boys' movie with a big bang finish,1
" Not only does it uncannily evoke the feelings of awkwardness, alienation and excitement that come with being a teenager, but it conjures the kind of suspense that will give your armrests a workout.",1
" Bears an atypically vervy style for a first-time filmmaker, Wayne's World star Mike Myers, who touches on his own rough patch and Gordon's saintly intervention.",1
" While the 3D beasts are undeniably impressive, their human counterparts remain resolutely two-dimensional thanks to a script that mistakes tone-deaf jumps and starts for emotional arcs.",0
 White Boy Rick exudes empathy for its titular character and his situation. ,1
 Lazer Team is meant to be a fun science fiction adventure that should appeal to those who grew up watching these kinds of movies as kids.,1
 The best Bond movie in decades.,1
" You would have to be somewhere beyond deep-geek to defend Ghost Rider's unholy melding of religious mumbo-jumbo to motorcycle worship, western folklore, father-son psychology, and Elvis Lives wish fulfillment.",0
" While little touches here and there can't help but excite the senses, the lack of a nuanced story or intriguing characterizations makes maintaining interest for all two hours utterly ridiculous.",0
" The story is really all over the place, but it's your only choice for an Easter Bunny movie for miles around, so expect to see this one cycled around again each spring.",1
" Zathura is welcome late-year fun for all ages -- a pleasant contrast to the nauseating dreck that normally masquerades as family-friendly science fiction. (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds... need I go on?).",1
" Some legs of the journey are detours, and the film can feel overlong and diffuse, but as a capsule history it offers revelatory insights, particularly in its emphasis on the role of distance running in the women's movement.",1
" Idris Elba's performance of Mandela is striking, if only for his effort to master the former president's distinct vocal style.",1
" a lackluster, overly cheesy film desperately trying to grasp hold of something that was hip and cool more than a decade ago",0
 The film's transformation from bleeding-out grim to blender-on-the-head silly is pretty hard to take.,0
" Were it not for the gravity and thoughtfulness of Morgan Freeman's performance as a retiring policeman, and the third-act appearance of its bizarre villain, Seven would be unendurable.",0
" Whatever statement Lester wanted to make is lost as a result, whether he did predict the decline of schools a moot point.",0
" ''I didn't want to resort to violence. I didn't have a choice,'' [Seagal] says; a greater man might have said, ''Make my day.''",0
" The film may be too preposterous to take seriously, but at least writer-director Aram Rappaport trains his sights on the right enemies.",0
" The movie around them has problems, but Amy Adams and Emily Blunt put on a first-class acting workshop.",1
" Williams is fascinating to watch on screen ... but a strong performance does not necessarily an entertaining movie make, and there seems to be little point or purpose to this.",0
" Fans of sophisticated humor may feel empathy with, if not sympathy for, the lead character on those many occasions he is kicked in the nuts.",0
" Gonzo, the documentary by Alex Gibney, taps the full fascination of its subject: Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.",1
" There are plenty of effective jump scares, and it's nicely shot, but beneath the surface there isn't a great deal going on.",1
" The film has its moments and Aidan Gillen is impressive as the Hibernian hanger-on from hell, but it's a slight affair.",1
 Sharper direction and a less throwaway tone would have allowed it to add up to more.,0
" Pretty much everyone in Blockers, right down to one-joke supporting characters, is at least amusing and good-hearted-and maybe, as the movie winds down, just a little too quick to make nice.",1
" Thematically it works, even when it falls short dramatically.",1
" The weight of the film, though, is on Gordon-Levitt and Woodley and these are easily two of the best performances of the year.",1
" Two incredibly talented stars, at different ends of their careers, somehow brought together by the lowest points on their CVs.",0
 A scattershot Southern melodrama that can't decide what it's supposed to be.,0
" To appreciate Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns, there's really only one requirement: Loosen up.",1
 The Punisher is Commando with an identity crisis.,0
" Under Craig Gillespie's uninspired direction, the humor eventually settles into stale, familiar pratfalls.",0
 An effective satire that deserves recommendation.,1
" Despite (or maybe because of?) all the impressive graphics, first-time director Joseph Kosinski imparts no heat or urgency or need to care.",0
" this uncompromising, unapologetically unpleasant addition to the post-apocalyptic subgenre invites us, along with Eva, to bear witness to the end of everything that we take for granted and hold dear, with all sentiment and hope forever locked out.",1
" [Demetri Martin] makes the transition into feature filmmaking as writer, director and star with just the right blend of humor and heartbreak. ",1
 It's a shame that the director/co-writer's philosophy is less fascinating than his set designs. ,0
 ... more concerned with bloody fights and weaponry than any meaningful character or thematic depth.,0
" The Dark Tower is King's ultimate roller coaster - twisting and stomach-clenching and terrifying but, above all, fun. If only this version was as thrilling a ride.",0
" Normally, the range of an actor's performance can be obscured by the lulling progression of a character arc, but 21 Grams, by its very fractal nature, exposes its keynote sequences as naked snapshots of emotion.",1
" The screenplay sometimes overdoes the winking asides, and the film doesn't so much flow as jump from one set piece to the next. But Anderson has created a world as stylized and inventive as anything he's done.",1
" A vintage throwback feel recalls several other touchstone movies of its 1980s era, while the reset hews true to the dark, twisted soul of King's source material. ",1
" The path to the ending is littered with dick jokes, but Fist Fight makes the early hardships worthwhile.",1
 Its themes and visual splendor demonstrably trump the sometimes-ludicrous bombast accompanying them.,1
 ... a Sleepy Hollow-like folk tale that is light on character development and heavy on symbolism and suggestion.,1
 A film divided against itself cannot stand.,0
" The movie builds up to a mystery that it never does much to resolve, with its big set piece reveal consisting mostly of a couple of rocks moving.",0
" This film introduces us to a new, younger, more upbeat, lively Spider-Man and some good new characters, including a more complex, believable villain than one usually sees in these kinds of films.",1
" It's a brilliant combination of light and darkness, tenderness and violence and, yes, laughter and tears.",1
" Has some hilarious moments, mostly thanks to Will Ferrell's zany slapstick, mugging, and other antics.",1
" Essentially an extended music video, and with about as much narrative weight, August Rush is empty, flat, and pointless.",0
 This is an inspirational melodrama derailed by the low stakes of the subject and the flaws of its hero.,0
" This is sweet and affectionate biopic. If you appreciate the comedy of a gentler time, its nostalgic re-creation of the final performances of two beloved comedy icons will definitely make you smile.",1
" ...it's hard to imagine anything being worse than this week's repellant 3D wasteland The Legend of Hercules, a movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head.",0
 McConaughey is mildly coasting. He has danced these steps before.,0
 Forced bits of padding such as those just show that the concept really doesn't merit more than the five minutes its allotted on Saturday nights.,0
" Not unpleasant in a bland Masterpiece Theatre way, but not very faithful to its astringent source either...easy to sit through but not particularly engaging.",0
" Unfortunately, the directors missed an opportunity to bring attention to the fact that the chimpanzee population has been reduced by some 80 per cent. ",1
" Testament of Youth is refreshingly old school in its approach, shunning frantic editing and acting histrionics to keep things strictly British and stiff upper lip.",1
" With one film, Estevez has transformed himself from a middle-aged joke into a youthful auteur who has made something beautiful, something he can be proud of, one of the best films of 2006.",1
" ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" will test your optimism.",0
 It's about as clever and sophisticated as a late-period Garry Marshall movie.,0
 The couple's fluctuations between amorous rapture and wounding are matched by the film's own seesaw of poignancy and irritation,0
" Evelyn has little to do with real life. For a more realistic true story, try this: Clueless moviemakers sucker innocent moviegoers into paying nine bucks for a stupid movie.",0
 Here is a virtuosic display of Todd Haynes' capacity for reflecting Dylan's forward thinking via a blend of perfectly coded vignettes. It's not a film for lazy audiences.,1
" The Muppets' flaws are numerous, yet not substantial enough to put off true Muppets fans. ",1
 Overall the movie feels like a miss.,0
 This is a world in which time and space have no meaning.,0
 Ian McShane gives Blackbeard as much menace as a goofball romp can handle.,1
 Veteran documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield makes an impressive leap to features with Ghosts.,1
 There's some pretty solid and rather nifty playing with time travel in Reset. That is until the third act...,0
" Like some wonderful kind of live-action Studio Ghibli effort that has somehow found its way across the Pacific and onto America's ravaged, weather-beaten doorstep.",1
" It remains faithful to the spirit of Seuss. The pro-conservation, anti-consumerist message of the book is heartily intact. And, like the Seuss story, the film never resorts to sermonizing.",1
" 'Elysium' goes overboard with loud, jerky, repetitive action sequences. ",0
" Quiet, contemplative and with an astonishing climax that spins the film on its head and gives it meaning and nuance I almost didn't see coming, this is a story of male friendship that's both stirring and powerful.",1
" The element of surprise proves to be Unbreakable's greatest virtue, not to mention a quality richer and more elegantly pulled off than it was in Sense.",1
" Mr Tinkles has to endure the humiliation of being dressed up in ridiculous outfits by his eccentric owner, meaning that he gets to deliver lines such as ""EVIL%u2026does NOT wear a BONNET!""",1
" As much the film prospers in its visual imagery, it fails with nearly everything else.",0
" Everything... concerning the royals -- portrayed with grace, aplomb, and resolute humanity by the wonderful Samuel West and the goddesslike Olivia Colman -- is fantastic. It's very much the sequel to The King's Speech...",1
 Kelly has unquestionably given us a bold and challenging work that is alive and kicking in every frame.,1
" Weaves a complex (and convoluted) tapestry of danger, betrayal, and a seemingly unending stream of car chases.",0
" All in all, another Friday the 13th flop. Albeit one with a glimmer of hope at its core.",0
" Despite its best efforts to be thought-provoking, the film is dramatically inert, slow and its revelations aren't all that politically illuminating, relying on coincidence and worn tropes to obfuscate its lack of ingenuity.",0
 Sam Raimi's fine slapstick skills shine to their best advantage.,1
" The result is less misstep than near-miss, a casualty of a script that doesn't quite recognize who (or what) should be the star of the show. ",0
" If DuVall's purpose was to provide a snapshot of her generation, she should have sharpened her focus. ",0
 Dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune.,1
 The truth is that I haven't seen nearly enough unimaginative martial-arts movies to respond to Mr. Chow's bizarre flights of fancy.,0
" Fans of smurfiness may well like it, and Gargamel gets some nice lines, but I have to say that both script and animation seemed are entirely predictable, as if generated by some computer software.",0
" Gyllenhaal may be convincing, even sympathetic, as a man in the manic throes of guilt, regret and emotional isolation he can barely register, let alone articulate. But the story ultimately strands his character in another limbo state.",1
" ...rooted in the horrific real-life mafia abduction of Giuseppe Di Matteo, but Grassadonia & Piazza shift their focus to the other Giuseppe - the one lodged in Luna's mind and heart - and let her imagination guide the story to magical realist realms.",1
 Ti West knows how to get under our skin and make us danse macabre.,1
" Murray's deadpan presence holds it all together. Like France's Jacques Tati, he's a master of minimalist angst and perfect straight man to a darkly comic world and Anderson keeps him skillfully positioned at the eye of the storm.",1
" This documentary covers a wide array of examples of the potentially scary downside of artificial intelligence, none particularly in depth but with enough ingenuity to cause alarm. ",1
" It's a film with much to say, about the shifting winds of technology, the challenges of art that stands the tests of time, and how we choose to think about the lives we've lived.",1
" A road movie with its creative lanes clogged, and a Mack truck comedian barreling through, anyway. Melissa McCarthy, pound-for-pound the funniest woman in show biz these days, carries this cruel and usual raunchfest practically by default. ",0
" A very good movie, and a faithful adaption of the book.",1
" These thoughtful people are paralyzed by their ability to look at their lives, and the lives around them, from too many angles. It's enlightening to listen to them, and perhaps a little too familiar.",1
" It's exaggerated, satirical, weird, and dark. The bad guys do genuinely horrifying things that will haunt your dreams. ",1
 What could have been a spirited dissection of Jay-Z's optimistic enterprise is instead merely an advertisement for it. ,0
" A B-movie extravaganza, Skyline is a sort of sci-fi sampler of every alien invasion movie ever made.",0
" Becoming Jane becomes a rather ordinary, though sporadically entertaining, game of dress-up.",0
" ""Venom"" is a textbook case of a comic-book film that's unexciting in its ho-hum competence, and even its visual-effects bravura.",0
" Call it a landlocked variant on Robinson Crusoe, but it's a hypnotic one, with a sense of mystery and interior life that are all its own.",1
 A deft balance of the pessimistic and the playful,1
" More fruitful by far to take the auteurist view and say that for Frankenheimer, Ronin is surrender.",1
 One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film. But in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that Ken Kesey found in the asylum.,0
" Powerful. Writer-director Sarah Polley rightly deserves the kind of praise heaped upon Sofia Coppola for the lousy ""Lost in Translation."" ",1
" The old adage says that poetry is what's lost in translation, but the poetry is all that survives in Sofia Coppola's wispy art film.",0
" David Frankel directs with a modesty and restraint that favors the people over the situations, and he really captures the chemistry of a family dog in the mix.",1
" ""What do women want?"" was a question that even confounded Freud. Despite its admirable intentions, ""Magic Mike XXL"" hasn't got a clue, either.",0
 The ultimate in corporate synergy.,0

" A rudimentary run-and-gun action thriller, American Assassin does the job in largely workmanlike fashion, save for the surprise sighting of prestige actor Michael Keaton... ",0
" The movie is best when it's about a married couple who inhabit action movies for a living, and falters when it wants to be an action movie itself.",0
" A bold, beautiful and way-out-there female revenge story that eschews the bloodless nature of most costume dramas to revel in the lusty passions, kinky hobbies and digit-dicing proclivities of its main characters.",1
" Superbad is cute if you like guys who aren't even remotely bad, in a coming-of-age tale so old-fashioned the girls might just as well be wearing bloomers.",1

 The precocious director is stuck with a lamentable case of arrested development.,0
 Whose Streets? does not pretend to be objective or chronological.,1

 Support the Girls invites questions about why it exists and whether it offers an experience worth the price of admission and the investment of time.,0
 Is this an ecological thriller? A searing look at mankind's destruction of our natural environment? A meditation on how ultimately powerless we are in the face of that same embattled nature? A comedy? An exercise in self-amusement? All of the above?,0
" If devastation porn is your cup of tea, this is the picture for you. That's all it has to offer-just monster-on-monster, building-bashing action like you haven't seen since maybe last week. ",0

 Tim Burton's muddled take on the classic Lewis Carroll tale has moments of lucidity but mostly seems as confused as its titular heroine.,0

 Look for the fiery display of pyrotechnics that conclude the Chinese art form.,1

 The film's contemporary relevance almost trumps its visual splendor.,1

" A freakier follow-up featuring creepy kids, villains who'll keep you up at night and camerawork that puts moviegoers in a state of impending dread.",1
 [Summer 1993] is a stupendously well-told story. [Full Review in Spanish],1
 The movie is relentless in how it poses questions about our culture's way of dealing with the power of female sexuality.,1
" Unfortunately, the central character is as small figuratively as he is literally, and that limits the movie's capacity to enthrall and engage.",0

 I enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to exactly the same degree I enjoyed Jurassic World.,0

" if mixed martial arts fans who view the film are forever after afraid of fighters getting aroused during a ground-and-pound session on the mat, then Baron Cohen did the job right.",1
" There's something sharper and smarter in Dear Dictator, but that ground is left regrettably unexplored; it's a film that ultimately doesn't live up to its premise. Going deeper would require considerably more guts.",0
" Considering how rarely Grant works, you'd expect genuine excellence in the scripts he picks. We'd expected more than this merely serviceable, not very believable Hollywood romcom.",0
 Enough of a pointed study of character that it's more than just a collection of some of the best and most ridiculous jokes in a generation.,1
" This is no perfect -- or even half-perfect -- game. It's another movie where conventions are subbed for life lessons, where the emotions are cued by golden oldies and where the motivation (at least on the studio's part) isn't love of the game but money.",0
" Part fantasy fulfillment, part paranoid thriller, this is a subversive Faustian tale.",1
 Even director Carl Franklin...can't prevent One True Thing from descending into chick-movie hell.,0

" The important question isn't ""What's going on?"" but ""Why should we care?"" Vanilla Sky, unfortunately, can't come up with an answer.",0
 2012 is all about this irrational determination to live and perpetuate our crappy civilization. The film concentrates fiercely on who's going to get a spot on the ark in the end.,1
 It stumbles along as you're forced to sit through quite a bit of umming and aaahing and a car chase that lasts five minutes too long.,0
" At its foundation, it's a movie I like. It's what's built on that foundation that's troubling.",0
" It's a well-made film, and New Orleans is crisply and interestingly shot by cinematographer Christopher Soos, but this ultimately looks like a TV movie dressed up for the big screen.",0
" Though it has moments of inspiration...at best the picture is only fitfully amusing, certainly not up to the standard set by the 'South Park' movie.",0
" Much of Valkyrie works, but not quite enough.",0

 A very entertaining and original film with a great script and pretty decent performances. [Full review in Spanish],1
 This is a genre and genres apparently have rules. And one rule for this genre is; make it absurd.,0

 This movie is an astoundingly colorful and exceedingly entertaining showcase of Demonic Superheroes vs. Slimy Monsters.,1
" Kore-eda's sense of style remains enticing, but he might just as well have made a pulpy John Grisham-type yarn.",1
 It's a gripping and absolutely fascinating drama and Welles is utterly unparalleled.,1

" So visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand.",1
" Directed in moody and portentous strokes by Nicolas Winding Refn, this is the most abstract Viking movie you'll ever see...",0

 It had me in its spell from start to finish and I ran the gauntlet of every possible emotion along the way. Outstanding.,1
 The first sign The Taqwacores will be rough-going is when a character shows up in a burqa covered in crust-punk patches... and it's not a gag. ,0

" Silly, sloppy, and liberated from any sense of pacing or plot",0
 This is one of the best films of 2015.,1

" Fiery, intense moments are undermined by a predictable plot.",0
" Often considered one of the greatest actors of his generation, Bale's performance is shockingly lifeless.",0
" With each sequel, quality receives a KO.",1

" The more preachy and pious the film becomes, the more muddled and unexciting it starts to feel.",0
" Absurdly set in some pre-cell-phone, post-Amadou Diallo alternate universe and generously stocked with logical inconsistencies, Phone Booth is best appreciated as hilarious pulp metaphor.",1

 The Walk turns what is a relatively straightforward act - albeit a scarily placed one - into something stunning by restoring a sense of physicality to what's happening onscreen.,1
" Underneath all the fuss, there's a half-baked plot that fails to make much of a connection.",0
" A straight line in desperate need of curves. Of course, if the movie understood curves the whole four different-shaped-gals-sharing-jeans thing wouldn't really work.",0
" This is one of the big dangers for the extended franchise model of filmmaking -- that characters and series will be kept alive not because there's a story to tell, but because the franchise must be kept alive.",0

" The film is touching and small, but also thoughtful and assured in a way that lingers after the inevitable tears have been shed and the obvious lessons learned.",1
" The extreme contrivance of the scenario extends to a lot of Locke's lines to the people he's on the phone with. It may never leave the car, but it wants to stuff that car full of as much meaning and drama as it can.",0
 There's a stronger version of this story in which we get to know these four guys before going through Hell with them instead of racing to get there.,0
 The movie slogs like honey dripping off a butter knife. It doesn't help that Prince-Bythewood slams the audience with heavy-handed symbolism.,0

 The Future Is Written is a loving testimonial to one of rock's true originals.,1

 Abrahamson has made a deeply moving story about how adults try to explain the world to their children - even when they don't always understand it themselves.,1

 More like a skit that doesn't know when to pack it in.,0
 Much cybercandy here to chew on.,1
" It features a profoundly interesting story, with harrowing and distressing undertones but the film's inability to press issues further and delve deeper into its subject matter makes it somewhat of a rubber stamp.",0

" A beautiful, dumb cowboy movie about two beautiful, dumb cowboys.",1
" The pitch of Sicario's intensity is like a scream, underlined by the film's ominous score as it deliberates its moral quandary",1

" On paper, and sometimes even on-screen, there's some promise and potential in this remake ... An intractable problem is that the Jesus scenes are among the film's weakest moments.",0
" The trouble with that is that Beyond the Hills seems like a movie that's been almost preconceived to be powerful. There's a grandiosity to it, but not much mystery.",0

" McCarthy offers an excellent performance as Lee, tempering her usual over-the-top comedic style while retaining her wit, and burying herself in a frumpy delivery that is just sympathetic enough to pity.",1
" Disconnected significantly from the flow of logic between the first and second installments of Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" films, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a disjointed mess. ",0
" In Joshua Oppenheimer's extraordinary The Act of Killing, film becomes the medium for a bold historical reckoning--and in more ways than one.",1

" This biopic of legendary London-born rock 'n' roller Ian Dury marks the rise of a serious talent. In fact, you'll be wowed by Serkis's performance as Dury - even if, like me, you don't know the first thing about the bloke he's playing.",1
" Bateman tackles a more subtle blend of comedy and drama with mixed results, but plenty of tonal intrigue. His quest to become a serious filmmaker continues to show potential.",1

" Features a commitment to craft that helps overcome issues of storytelling by providing a visceral, violent experience designed to get you in your gut and bones more than in your heart or head.",1
" Even the fight scenes are dull, shrouded in dust, and janky with slo-mo. Honestly, the sword-wielding situation was so meh that I found myself obsessing over the few little things that hadn't been blobbed up by CGI.",0
" The story includes too many twists, resulting in a sense of contrivance by film's end. Yet this is still a decent, serious film that's capably directed and very nicely acted.",1
 Blandly generic in its images and atmosphere.,0
" It wasn't necessary to fill in all the gaps about Han Solo's life before Luke Skywalker enlists his help in a Tattooine cantina, but the movie exists anyway, and it's a whole lot better than most cinematic prequels.",1
" Joining the rank ranks of The Hottie And The Nottie, Gigli, Licence To Wed and any film where Matthew McConaughey gets his groove on with a girl is yet another unspeakably awful rom-com.",0
" It's just kind of a mess, as unfocused and immature as the four mutant turtles at its core. Stuff happens, stuff blows up and this is probably a good time to mention that Michael Bay produced the film.",0
" Joe Lynch just goes for it in this maxed-out mutant sequel, sating the errant appetites of gorehounds everywhere.",1
" Brevity is the soul of camp, and at close to two-and-a-half hours, Boll's film is just too exhausting to be fun.",0
" Costars John Cleese, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Andy Garcia, and Jeremy Irons look either bored or desperate, gasping for laughs in an airless screenplay.",0
" If you can't make a decent movie through normal means, relying on non-stop distractions to keep the thing humming along isn't the worst plan B.",1
" It's a profoundly moving book. Still, the movie is strangely remote, and straining for tears.",0
 A potent film with strong performances that will bolster your belief that change can still be made with the right level of conviction.,1
" Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial New Yorker if 26-year-old Reese Witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character, Melanie Carmichael, with a massive infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic.",1
" I laughed long and hard at Pee-wee's corny puns and throwback sensibilities, a satirical reflection of times when innuendo wasn't always intentional, but was all the funnier for it.",1
" The movie's concluding notes of cautious optimism feel earned, but just barely.",1
" It's not really possible to fully divorce Wonder Woman from the fact that its simple existence feels like a big, revolutionary ""event"" in and of itself.",1
 You could feel like everybody felt like they were making something that they were really proud of.,1
 [A] surprisingly poignant portrait of the willful abandonment of reality in favor of pop cultural oblivion.,1
 A loss of empathy for the hero vampire drains the lifeblood out of this project. Flaws don't necessarily derail a film -- but nothing nails the coffin shut quite like an unlikeable Barnabas Collins.,0
" Even if you're nostalgic for, say, Galaxy of Terror or Death Race 2000, you're better off waiting for this one on video.",0
" Represents a lost opportunity to give children, not to mention adults, a movie experience that would widen their eyes as the justly beloved Rowling books did.",0
" Gracie, a tale about a teen girl blazing trails in soccer, is worthy, but it's also formulaic to a fault.",0
 Well-acted but badly miscalculated.,0
" Going in Style is not a bad film by any means, but its biggest crime is being an unimpressionable one.",0
" Trippy in one sense but trite in another...contains some genuinely gonzo eye-candy, but the weirdly imaginative images are wedded to a tired script. ",0
" The 3D is barely-there, the clanging machine-rock soundtrack is merciless, and the traps are decidedly ho-hum. Even running its final lap, Saw still oozes mediocrity.",0
 Michelangelo Antonioni's classic vision of alienation returns.,1
" A mediocre multitude of mutants...with no character development, meaning no emotional investment.",0
 Banksy exposes the con-job that is modern art for what it is.,1
" Even allowing for toilet humor, long a prerequisite for mainstream comedies, the humor in 'Along Came Polly' doesn't have much texture.",0
" The second chapter only cemented my love for the story & characters, but also my belief that this story in either 3-or-6 hour intervals won't be fully served until The Return of the King ends.",1
" Glazer, a Murray confidante who most notably worked with him on ""Scrooged"", must secretly hate his friend for putting him through this mess. ",0
" 1995 is long gone, and so are that year's standards.",0
 A more troubling and rigorous inquest into a bygone era than usual.,1
" Because much of [the movie's] drama takes place on the set of a globally franchised game show..., the plucky Jamal becomes an underdog hero the whole world can love and root for.",1
" Like any documentary about putting on a show, Full Battle Rattle abounds with mirth-provoking incongruities between the effect aimed for and the means used to achieve it.",1
 John Miller's good-natured picture makes a noble stab at yoking real-world social problems to capering.,0
" It's easy to be distracted by the talking cat or the talking moon, but they are merely wallpaper over a yawning chasm of panic and disappointment.",1
" As the narrative lugubriously sticks to the documented events, we are served nothing more than a filmed transcript.",0
" Brent's big comeback won't disappoint fans, but would've worked fine as another Christmas special. In 2004.",1
" People go into the woods, and they don't come out. Add a man-eating whatsit, and you've got a horror movie. Not a very good horror movie. But, certainly genre fans get what they want, some old-fashioned blood-and-guts. Chomp, chomp.",0
" Instead of focusing only on the director's patented thematic and stylistic motifs, [De Palma] calls attention to the patterns of its subject's personality.",1
" It's a well shot film with beautiful cinematography, though it does feel a bit too constrained at times. But as beautiful as it was, the story and characters failed to grab me",0
 Just My Luck is a bit of lukewarm cappuccino froth confected to float Lindsay Lohan to the next stage of her career.,0
" The film is a challenging watch, and it's hard to amply describe its pleasures in words - its poignancy is in a deep affiliation with the life of a crumbling urban centre.",1
" Being so sour about Fletch makes one feel like Kvetch, but seriously, is all it takes to be a screen comic the ability to flare the nostrils and to fall down?",0
 Those expecting wanton alien bashing will not be disappointed ... but be prepared for more of a sentimental time-travelling journey down memory lane ...,1
" You would be better off spending 96 minutes stuck in the parking garage of the movie theater instead of in the multiplex watching it%u2013at the very least, the carbon monoxide fumes probably won't kill as many brain cells.",0
" Smart enough to ask its viewers why exactly they're finding so much enjoyment in watching this horror show unfold, this is true crime done right.",1
 A winning hand indeed.,1
" Although its leads find the odd moment of charm together, The Upside fumbles far too often when it attempts to enlighten or edify its audience.",0
" A tired, predictable, bordering on offensive, waste of time, money and celluloid.",0
" The Kite Runner feels authentic in its ethnic tensions, even when the narrative itself, with its handily reappearing and easily avenged villain, undermines that authenticity.",0
" If there was ever any thought that perhaps Whale Rider was a fluke, North Country should erase all doubt.",1
" I can't say I minded the movie too much, but I can't say it ever grabbed me, which is how I feel about every other movie adapted from an Irving novel.",0
 Gangs of New York offers technical proficiency and narrative mediocrity.,1
" The film's good cheer seems less infectious than enforced; the cinematic embrace is stifling, and the good vibes feel overdone and oversold, like a present-tense trip of instant nostalgia.",0
 I wouldn't be surprised to see Zama canonized as one of the more remarkable artistic achievements of this decade. It's certainly a standout of 2018.,1
 Viewers have almost two hours to become thoroughly disgusted,0
 Adapting Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was always going to be a tall order for any director. In first-timer Ewan McGregor's hands it's entirely unwieldy.,0
" Fast and furiously good natured, it certainly puts the gas into gastropod.",1
 The strongest and most nuanced performance is Trine Dyrholm as Anna... Dyrholm solidly sells us on Anna's delight and angst as the tale unfurls.,1
" It's a wearyingly familiar story -- and even the jokes, mostly insect puns, aren't the kind that adults are likely to enjoy. ",0
" A cleareyed, disarmingly tender teenage romance that bears comparison with the best of its genre, both old (""Say Anything"") and new (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"").",1
" So slyly and craftily entertaining even though it probably doesn't bear close scrutiny, I didn't much care. It wasn't epic. It didn't ask me to ponder the meaning of life. And it's good.",1
 What could have been a gimmick turns out to be philosophical and heartfelt.,1
" [Maria] Mozhdah empathetically charts Nisha's despairing acquiescence and fitful rebellions, but it's Adil Hussain's work making her father not entirely unsympathetic that really stands out.",1
" ""The Visit"" is the kind of exciting horror experience crowds will eat up, just like one of Nana's cookies.",1

" While the title may suggest violence and mayhem, this film is actually a character drama and a stylish one at that. It is a restrained story that meticulously unpacks its characters and shows rather than tells.",1
 Part One of director Peter Jackson's planned film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in.,1
 The Glass Castle tortures more than graces.,0

 Another memorable piece of storytelling from the Oscar-winning director.,1
" We don't get much backstory, and there are maybe 50 lines of dialogue in the whole thing. But that's kind of a good thing, since newcomer Linder mumbles the dialogue she's given. Krill's much better.",0
" He's not reinventing the genre, but he doesn't have to. He already did that once, and now he's just doing what he's good at. His era of in your face outrageousness didn't last long enough as far as I'm concerned.",1
" Those expecting another ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" are sure to be disappointed with this effort, as Reubens and co-writer Paul Rust dial down idiosyncrasy, keeping ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday"" friendly, but rarely surprising. ",1
" What was once a dark horror/sci-fi/western is now a generic and unoffensive Young Adult flick, palatable to nobody and focus group tested within an inch of its life.",0
" Gere is earnest, but at least he's not being warm and fuzzy. The actor's unshaven face puts a face on a problem that the public has grown accustomed to ignoring.",1
" The lively setting helps, but the main attration here is the familiar story, which has been around forever and yet never gets old.",1
 There's a difference between tart and vinegary and Maps to the Stars is consistently on the wrong side of it.,0
" The audience is subject to a constant tone of foreboding danger, but The Box is more tease than delivery.",0
 The House Bunny stays simplistic just like Legally Blonde. Anna Faris deserves better.,0
" Sudeikis is devilish but sensitive in banter that is not necessarily one-liner jokes, but is always funny. Brie is able to be simultaneously sexual and acutely vulnerable. ",1
" Equal parts earnest public service announcement and screwball family drama, About Ray has more issues with identity than its titular character.",0
" It's only a few weeks before Christmas, and do you know what that means?... it means horror movies about human organ trafficking.",0
" This is a fresh inversion on the usual ""is the artificial lifeform an actual human being?"" story. ",1
" This rip-roaring tribute to a maverick artist trips along like a surreal odyssey, punctuated by lively reminiscences, choice clips and superb photographic material.",1
 Bekmambetov needs to stop trying to copycat Hollywood with his action sequences and tighten up his storytelling.,0
" It's not exactly ""Ratatouille,"" but this quasi-animated movie makes an amusing late-summer vacation from superheroes and shoot-'em-ups.",1
 While Dark of the Moon isn't a tired movie experience -- the wizardry has moments of near-Avatar brilliance -- it can be a tiring one.,0
" Who wouldn't love a story about a homeless golden retriever who runs away from his alcoholic clown for a father, Norm, to shoot hoops? ",1
 The film appears to have been assembled by agents with stopwatches on their clients.,0
 Movies are far too expensive to waste your hard earned money on this mess.,0
" Wolverines and Cougars aside, there are more than one strokes responsible for violating their own rules and putting a name on the film that is only an introduction to what's wrong with it.",0
" Lurie makes the same point as Peckinpah, namely that, when survival is threatened, even the most civilised types have a primal capacity for violence. But, 40 years on, the shock factor has gone.",0
" There's a funny movie scratching at the edges of ""This is 40.""",0
" This supposed action-comedy is so staggeringly unfunny, unoriginal and uninspired that its title should have been Agent Cody Banks 2: Contractually Obligated Sequel.",0
 Easily the most exhilarating lesson in racial politics you're ever likely to sit through.,1
" Elvis & Nixon is at its best when it sticks to what-if whimsy and the enjoyable fantasy of worlds colliding, with all the outlandish possibilities that crossover stories suggest.",1
" Mostly this is just too mild, too quiet, too distant. It tracks its target. But it never quite manages to get it in its sites.",0
" Director Xavier Dolan is fast cementing himself as a writer-director willing to take risks. It might well result in a film that boasts many imperfections, but it's commendable nevertheless.",1
 The performances and narrative flounder to strike the right balance between comedy and drama. ,0
" While the story is effective in delving into that more human side to one's personal relationship with religion, its characters could be portrayed with more depth and respect.",1
" Gosford is fine, well-groomed entertainment, but the road it takes has already been well paved.",1
 Dear White People succeeds because it delivers its message with common sense and wisdom instead of a heavy hand.,1
" ...an art-house horror film - 10% The Red Shoes, 20% Pi, and 70% Polanski's Repulsion. ",1
" Very little of Lang's early work remains available to watch in this condition. Destiny is a real treat. Watch it, and see if it can inspire you as it did the likes of Alfred Hitchcock.",1
" Commingling industry shoptalk with introspective insights and wrangling testimonials, the film casts an incredibly wide net, but doesn't reveal much of anything. ",0
" [Morris's] new comedy has a provocative, ticklish premise -- five North England Muslims become suicide bombers, but can't decide who or what to take with them.",0
" A tangled and pedestrian narrative gets in the way of the thrills, which are still considerable.",0
 Overly crude body-swapping comedy isn't for kids.,0
" Even worse, Corbell never digs directly into Lazar's claims. His failure to locate any sort of authenticity proves to be the film's worst feature, of many. ",0
" It may lack the subtleties and emotional wallop of a lo-fi musical like Once, but Sunshine On Leith delivers a bright, cheery, big-hearted smile of a movie.",1
" It's legitimately exciting. The car chase scenes are phenomenal. And Aaron Paul shows that he can very much carry a movie as the lead. About that plot, though...",1
 The third time is not exactly a code of charms for producer/director Ron Howard and Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) in their intricately weaved 'Inferno.' ,0
" Offers far more than a thesis about repressed desire; it evokes and engages such desire, seeking its release.",1
" Though it's irresistibly funny and filled with insane (but true) details, this is ultimately a sad story about a woman who was mistreated from day one.",1
" It's an arthouse Marley & Me, a one-woman/one-dog Grapes of Wrath and an Americanized Umberto D with a score comprised of Williams' occasional humming.",1
" Critically lauded at the time of its release, Cimarron was beloved by most who saw it. Eight decades later, it is frequently cited on lists of the most undeserving Academy Award winners.",0
" Avoid the movie so you won't waste 90 minutes of your life on an unfunny, derivative mess.",0
" Has the lasting power of a quarter-mile race. When it's over, all you're left with is fumes.",0
" With this last of the central Star Wars cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun.",1
" Given the quality of the cast,...this highly uneven, ill-constructed comedy is a disappointment.",0
" Besides adolescent girls who either want to be Hilary Duff or want to slobber over Chad Michael Murray, the story offers nothing new to an already beaten-to-death teen genre.",0
 ... another slick and calculated beachfront love story that should please Sparks' legions of indiscriminate fans while making even casual cynics cringe.,0
 [Makes] a strong case that animation is the natural medium for the comic book movie.,1
" As a film and novel, Midnight's Children is a great baggy work ...",1
 An out-of-the-blue delight...I found (central character K. Roth) Binew to be inspiring and damn funny in his lack of a psychological/vocal filter.,1
" Has style to spare, but none of the novel's shock value",0
 A wasted concept that fails to take advantage of its own originality.,0
" With ""Jimmy's Hall,"" Ken Loach creates a quiet but compelling drama about a real-life story.",1
" Every time Wahlberg and Ferrell share scenes of bromance, you can't help but smile.",1
" Though Wahlberg is a fine actor, there's no way I can buy him as a college English professor holding forth on Shakespeare and Camus.",0
" Arrival may offer a few too many metaphors to keep some viewers engaged. But it's guaranteed to stick in your mind a fair amount longer than, say, Men in Black 3.",1
" Though sporadically funny, this blackish comedy would have been far better had it been a lot darker...settles for sitcom-level shenanigans and mild raunchiness before coasting into an ending that effectively cops out.",0
" The script is a pathetic hodgepodge ... the acting is horrible, and the 'surprise' ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple.",0
 A film that honors its genre and is a disaster. [Full Review in Spanish],0
" Hurrah -- let's teach our kids that if you look good and are skilled at making up convincing lies, everyone will love you.",0

 A step up from the run of fare ordinarily targeted at the so-called urban audience...But it doesn't step up far enough.,0
" Dialogue has never been Besson's strong suit, and so Valerian is at its best when it's wordless. The Fifth Element director's calling is finding the fun between the operatic and the trashy, with visuals that are both busy and elegant.",0

" A belabored, often laughable melee of sound, fury and unnecessarily frenzied cinematography in which everyone yells, screams and threatens while any sense of dread quickly drains away.",0
" Filmgoing is affirmed as a communal experience that can transform lives in dark, uncertain times.",1
" You'd never know from License to Wed that Krasinski is a big asset to The Office. Here, playing an unappealing male lead, he merely smugs his way through the assignment.",0
" With raw emotional scenes but a great deal of deadpan humour, the witty script really hits it out of the park.",1
" The dimly lit, exquisitely composed cinematography, by Guillermo Nieto, adds to the draw of this highly recommended movie.",1
 You're in for a mildly entertaining ride through lowbrow slapstick action violence. Just don't ask for a seat in the non-smoking section.,0

" This buddy/action/adventure/comedy/based on true story movie tells an interesting enough tale. But, oh, if it only had the guts of its no-good heroes.",0
" It highlights Burton's usual strengths, along with no small number of his weaknesses.",1
" This is a story that had potential, but Michod's unwillingness to develop any of it only leads it down the path to becoming another small, forgotten film that no one's likely to take any notice of.",0
" A cynical, chill-inducing, blood-splattering cinematic operetta! Forget about your preconceptions - and relish one of the 10 Best Movies of 2007.",1

 Unforgettable isn't an effective thriller. ,0
" While the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he's straining to execute a dead lift.",0
" We wish this left a sour taste in the mouth, instead it leaves nothing.",0
" From the - 'wait how did he get there so fast?' moments, to the cringe and chuckle-worthy one-liners, you know this movie came to play.",1
" This dud recreation of the 1992 L.A. riots traps Halle Berry and Daniel Craig and a piece of momentous, civil-rights history in a crazyquilt of random action, absurdist humor, bogus romance and questionable purpose.",0
" Decker captures the emotional caprices of her characters with thrilling immediacy, allowing her sociopolitical commentary to trickle in through background details.",1
" Unfortunately, the film never hits the emotional highs or lows it's aiming for, and the comedy is too sedate to be enough to carry the film: it's more likely to induce silent chuckles than laughs.",0
 The fine cast tries in vain to elicit empathy for characters that are defined by their individual failures and nothing more.,0
 Briskly paced at 88 minutes and full of fun and spectacle. (Full Content Review for Parents also available),1

" It's not a total 180 -- there is still working-class despair, and a fair share of violence, some of it related to football and guns. But it leaves you with a smile on your face, for the right reasons.",1
" A wild ride of a movie, Spring Breakers finds gleeful cinematic provocateur Harmony Korine pitching a bunch of former teen starlets into a headlong spree of sex and drugs and gangsta rap.",1

" Though it looks good and sounds better, Tintin is frustrating to watch.",0
" Here's a two-fisted shero prepared to prove, in convincing fashion, that a girl can grow up to be anything she wants to be. A priceless primer for impressionable tykes!",1

" It's a sitcom-y, Sarandon-wrapped Mother's Day valentine.",1
 Or 'My Not-So-Big-and-Fat Gay Italian Son'...one dance you might just want to sit out.,0

" There's hardly anything that comes across as original in Conrad's story, although the nitty-gritty details on modeling offer up some peculiar examples of fashion's ugly underbelly.",0
 The worst kind of independent; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors,0
" The issues may be simply put, but the brilliant action sequences engage us viscerally.",1

 [Another Mother's Son] feels more like a TV movie than anything cinematic.,0

" Toothless and Hiccup are back, and that is all you need to know before buying tickets to see this film. What will keep you engaged is the mature, natural growth of its characters and the feelings of reconnecting with and saying goodbye to old friends.",1
 Sometimes hot messiness has its charms.,1
" Miracle at St. Anna wants to do too many things at once to do any of them with much verve. It aspires to be a war epic, but it's dominated less by combat than by flat, meandering talk.",0

" It's not what you'd call ""major"" cinema, but it's a breezy entertainment, particularly if you're a fan of one or more of the cast members.",1
" An overwhelmingly unoriginal thriller. ""The Sacrament"" borrows heavily, if not totally, from the 1978 Jonestown Massacre. But, it can't get the chills that even a bad documentary on Jonestown could give.",0
" At its best it is placid, and sort of middling, this Mere Dad Ki Maruti. ",0
" The film is colored by how time reshapes our sense of self, embracing some memories while occluding others, and it ingeniously folds us into a similar state of reflection and uncertainty about previous eras of false optimism about national values. ",1
 It develops an almost mournful empathy for its subjects as they fall from great heights to merely impressive ones.,1
 The Hobbit and 'Game of Thrones' both have done this form of the fantasy genre much better in recent years.,0

" There's authenticity as the teenagers feel tempted and/or trapped, and adults sometimes do more talking than listening.",1
" Plenty of thrills, just enough bedroom action, and a smattering of witty retorts to keep things crackling.",1
" It's coarse, clumsy and interminable, the lameness of its script matched only by the ineptitude of its execution.",0
 That Martin even has a pink house-servant costume for Latifah to wear suggests a dysfunction far more deeply embedded in the film's (and our collective) psyche.,0
 A fun but admittedly violent comedy that features a truly great standout performance by Ryan Gosling.,1
" Those unfamiliar with [Scott Walker] or, especially, those who don't like his music, will be only moderately engaged and ultimately underwhelmed.",0

" Even the A-movie budget can't disguise how hollow and insubstantial all of the death and destruction feels, even in action-movie terms.",0
" The Island is a different movie, with excellent special effects, an intelligent plot (and very deep for an action film), which I assure you will not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 This is not a film. It's propaganda.,0

 Arath de la Torre saves this movie and takes us back to a time where charisma and star power had more weight than the actual story itself. [Full review in Spanish],1
" An interesting meditation on life and death, periodically interrupted by excessive, skin-slashing, bone-snapping ultraviolence. ",1
 Hal is as much an elegy to auteurism as it is the story of a filmmaker's life. ,1
" Viggo Mortensen may be the most taciturn actor in American movies today. His weatherworn, handsome face (with a cleft chin to rival Kirk Douglas) communicates character with only the slightest of movement.",1
" Joy is for the most part a bewildering mess-possibly because its four credited editors are a sign of structural problems, possibly just because Russell throws too much directorial dash at us when he should be making things simple.",1
" [The film explores] what happens when you give those who have done something terrible (in this case, killing thousands) a forum through which to tell their story to see if a new perspective changes their attitude.",1

 The World feels too small in scope--ironic considering its title.,0
" To answer the question at hand, yes, The Avengers is pretty bad. Not slip-a-disk-running-from-the-theater kind of bad, but a shift-in-your-seat, ""oh-for-goodness'-sake-get-on-with-it!"" kind of bad.",0
 It's the rare film that discovers dignity in foolishness.,1

" The story is streamlined, simple and elegant, but the plot is thickly layered.",1
 The excellent first sequel to It's Alive expands the concept of the original and finds a more-confident Larry Cohen behind the camera. ,1
" It's rather slow and a bit overlong (139 minutes), it may not be for everyone, but for viewers with the patience, the rewards are many.",1

" Megatrash as only Bay can make it, this represents some of the most inane drivel ever to (dis)grace the screen-and an obscene waste of money to boot.",0
" It's so perfectly contrived and mechanical and fresh as a daisy, it's infuriating. And only the sly, insistently subversive Christopher Plummer is on our side.",0
" Though overwrought in its early scenes, the movie quickly settles into an intelligently faithful rendering of a calling to account, whose visceral power and political implications need no hyping.",1
" Throw in a couple of ugly new characters and one semi-nauseating barf joke, and ""The Nut Job 2"" marks the emergence of a consistently tone-deaf animated franchise.",0
" At no point does anyone involved with the film ever take this too seriously, and as long as one takes it in the same spirit, it's perfectly enjoyable.",1

 Lily James as Cinderella and Richard Madden as the Prince deliver fresh performances with a pleasant chemistry.,1
" It's not going to rock your world, but Guy Ritchie's take on the classic detective series has got a lot going for it. Most notably, of course, it's got Robert Downey, Jr. and that's just fine with me.",1

 Lord & Miller once again prove to be masters of dealing with deep and elaborated topics using sensible humor without feeling preachy [Full review in Spanish],1

 Let's just get this off our chests right now: Tower Heist is not a great movie.,0

 It's good for one reason: it killed Pauly Shore's career.,0

 Swing Vote suggests that a few hours of cramming is enough--our brief run-in with Palin confirms that it's not.,0

 The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility.,0

" The first two-thirds of the movie felt rather special, while the last third less so. Still, it has its charms, the kids are appealing and it's worth catching.",1
 This isn't the kind of comedy that you need to see more than once. It is one that you will want to see again and again just for the sheer pleasure.,1
" Regardless of the credibility of Read's exploits, Andrew Dominick has crafted a film that plunges his audience into the depths of Australia's criminal underworld.",1

 A suffocating and monotonous slow-boil Southern-gothic thriller.,0
 Director Lawrence ... gives the other characters a greater sense of development with the result that the movie doesn't come across as a Jennifer Lawrence Glorification Vehicle. ,1
" Jarmusch doesn't exactly reinvent the rock documentary with ""Gimme Danger,"" but he has a lot of fun with it and his scruffy, untamed subject. ",1
" Real Steel should not work on any level, but it succeeds on many, thanks to its appealing, unpretentious and deceptively involving approach to its tale.",1
 The film's saving grace is that fully a third of the film has the actors dancing rather than talking.,1
" as warm and affirming as its predecessor, and the manner in which it stakes its own claim to the material is just enough to make it feel like something more than just opportunism",1
" Tripp is such a stud that he has to beat women off with a stick. Or, rather, with his parents -- This isn't just idiotic, it's indefensible. It's also the picture's premise.",0

 Favreau had the opportunity to do something remarkable with Cowboys & Aliens but instead ended up making a movie that feels completely underwhelming once the credits start rolling. ,0

" Utterly, heartbreakingly lucid.",1
" You will be riveted to your seat in what is a refreshingly authentic film, which has not one false note.",1
" As often happens with video diaries, the film is limited in scope. But it is still an engrossing and important documentary that convincingly demonstrates that ME is real and gives voice to people whose homebound condition makes them largely invisible.",1
" Strangely, the further into the film the audience gets, the less tension-filled Wedding Guest becomes, making the conclusion feel both inevitable and uneventful ...",1
 It just felt like something was missing. nothing about this movie was very exciting. I'd say it was just a very average Sci-fi movie. ,0
 A superior film that it's predecessor that will leave the audience pleased. [Full review in Spanish],1
 Appropriately super. ,1
 Sort of like Meet the Parents... at Christmastime... without the laughs.,0
 Uncommonly flat and uninteresting.,0
" Is it perfect? No, but much like its underdog character, it works hard to make you like it and the payoff in the end is quite effective. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)",1
" Kirchheimer appears more interested in the way the subway interacts with urban life, cutting through neighbourhoods like a scalpel through flesh and how people have taken to the individual subway cars as canvases to educate, provoke, and infuriate. ",1
 Vincere maintains its grip through sheer flair.,1
" Us is most persuasive when compressed, when we're observing its concerns through the retina of Nyong'o performance.",1
 Lacks much of the sense of fun that made the original film a blast.,0
 This magical movie hits you in the emotional breadbasket and holds you in its enveloping grasp until its tearjerking conclusion.,1
 It's hard to think of a movie my feelings have been more divided on.,0
 The only reason you root for a reunion at the end of this unromantic romp is because these two jerks really deserve each other.,0
 Sub-par direction ruins whatever creativity and originality could be gleaned from the film's odd approach to the rape-revenge formula.,0
" ...the film is still a crowd pleaser, its dusky shadows, turn-of-the-century setting, menacing villain, and bizarre museum as creepy as ever.",1
" This film festival favorite is a genuine crowd pleaser, meant to right a few wrongs in the music industry, offer a window into the lives of some hard-charging entertainers, and above all make audiences leave the theater humming a song.",1
" The very pinnacle of the '80s action movie, and if it's not the greatest action movie ever made, then it's damn close.",1
" If only we had a more believable hero, and weren't feeling so disappointed at how little of the villain we get.",0
 The strength of this movie is also its biggest weakness: A Simple Favor boasts a heaping helping of self-awareness.,0
" A third class theme park ride, much too dark for children, too familiar for adults, and too lame for either.",0
 Disney underestimates the intelligence and sophistication of young audiences.,0
" McCarthy said she purposely resisted toning down Lee's antisocial, caustic, angry and miserable attributes. It is striking, then, that McCarthy's award-worthy performance as a decidedly unlikable woman is exactly what makes Lee Israel so captivating.",1
 The logic of the next scene is never as important to Harlin as the size of the next explosive charge.,0
 Brain bleeding miscasting.,0
" Star Chris Pratt says it best, 'It's adventure, it's romance, it's a thriller, it's scary, but it's emotionally resonant.' Amen. Once you accept the premise, with good acting and special effects, this is a terrific way to spend two hours.",1
 Paris Blues has something of his old intelligence and liking for authenticity.,1
" Even though it has visual beauty that makes it required viewing on the big screen, I can't endorse Crimson Peak or claim it is anything more significant than a disappointment.",0
" The Sapphires might pass muster as escapist fluff, but its pretensions of significance go woefully awry.",0
" So this is it: ground zero, the birth of horror cinema.",1
 This raunchy teen comedy is novel insofar as it recasts familiar gross-out gags from a female perspective; otherwise it's basically an American Pie knockoff.,0
 The Lucky Ones takes a decent premise -- three soldiers returning from Iraq facing domestic challenges upon their arrival home -- and crams so much forced drama into it that the movie devolves into a hack buddy picture.,0
 The pic scores big points by drawing a sharp distinction between corporate vidgame programmers and indies.,1
" This one is a few bits funnier than Malle's dud, if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks.",0
" Though slickly made, the film nicks through the varnish of celebrity to get these guys fully in touch with their inner music geek (which, honestly, is not that far under the surface).",1
 Any chemistry between Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan is stripped away by the repulsive traits of their characters.,0
" This movie isn't as daring as it pretends to be, but with two likable stars and a quotient of absurdity, ""What's Your Number?"" gets a passing grade.",1
" A stylish but desperately uneven French thriller that's clearly trying to be the next Godfather. Alas, it never comes close.",0
 Director Jack Heller's film may take the notion of implication over illustration a bit too far.,0
" A lot of blood, sweat and tears was obviously poured into ""Southpaw."" But very little sense.",0
 Phenomena (a.k.a. Creepers) provides what is alternately Argento's most batty and spiritual landscape.,1
" The real fun comes in navigating the puzzle, with solving it more the icing on top of a promising, multi-layered franchise cake.",1
" In the rush to put history onscreen, sometimes the need to put together something that first works as a film gets overlooked.",0
" The Ugly Truth is two movies for the price of one, but don't get too excited. You're not getting twice the entertainment, just twice as ripped off.",0
" [Danielle McDonald] carries the movie, and that's no small feat for a newcomer. I'm sure we'll be hearing a great deal more from her.",1
" The film is, as Rubin is fond of saying in interviews, a ""life-affirming"" film and has something to say about how we should view our brief stay on the planet.",1
 Curtis' 40-years-on return to the role is no cash-in; she gives an emotionally raw performance that makes Laurie the heart of the film.,1
" Despite its eccentric, boldly obvious central metaphor, the film feels bland and oddly inconsequential. ",0
 Too daft for drama and too solemn for satire. Merely lost.,0
" I sincerely hope no one involved with the script, or even the actors, actually thought people would laugh at remotely anything in this movie",0
" While the film has a good heart, it's arteries are filled with cheese.",0
" Jihadism is perpetually ablaze in the news, but the Mauritanian movie Timbuktu, a nominee for the best foreign film Oscar, gives those who suffer its condemnations a searingly human face.",1
" Some of this material is too sensitive, granted, to have a very young actor play it. But ""Jake"" goes too far the other way, giving us only glimpses of the boy, who emerges as more of a symbol than a real child.",0
" Compared to the likes of Adaptation and The Player, What Just Happened? is flyweight. De Niro is amiable enough in the lead role, but he's left to trot around a story that not so much bites the hand that feeds it as licks the palm.",1
" With princesses and romance for the girls, sword-fighting and derring-do for the lads, Tangled ticks boxes for both genders.",1

" Easily the most wildly innovative film of the year, despite the dull title, Bryan Barber's dynamo is a fusion musical.",1
" As a film, Barbara is as opaque as its glacial protagonist: Barbara is all about showing and not telling.",1

" Like Gatsby himself, the movie's a handsome attraction whose dizzying/vulgar wealth is unashamedly flaunted to court favour with bright young things.",1
" Patti Cake$ has a story that feels authentic and touching, a hard-knocks tale played to a hip-hop beat, and with a star-making turn by Australian actress Danielle Macdonald",1
" More understated than sidesplitting, this biting satire of showbiz offers an amusing enough inside peek at what life might be like in Tinseltown to remain recommended, its mostly inside industry jokes notwithstanding.",1

 And entertaining and visually dazzling story that is weighed down by being both an origin tale as well as the appetizer to a highly-anticipated film finale,1
" What we assume might turn into a patriarchal power struggle never reaches a boil, making for an overly sentimental movie that misuses the outsize talents of its two big stars.",0
" At the risk of overselling what is a good but not great movie, The Gambler is a slick, stylish thriller about gambling, self-destruction and personal redemption.",1
" 24 Exposures comes across like a clever idea that never got past the concept stage. It might have been fun for him to make, but it's definitely a chore to sit through.",0
" Taking advantage of the cinematic opportunities inherent to a story about the usefulness of eyes, the filmmakers creatively exploit the veteran's blindness for maximum tension.",1

" Ice Cube is sympathetic as the star, and Cedric the Entertainer tends to steal the show.",1
 It's repetitious and simply boring for anyone not touched by the holy spirit.,0
 Zemeckis -- relying both on Gordon-Levitt's energy and regular glimpses of Manhattan streets from more than 400 meters in the air -- manages to maintain a sense of tension. Even for those of us who know full well what happens.,1
 potentially decent film buried under the thick layers of misanthropy,0
" I think perhaps Sommers accomplished all that he wanted to with that first film, because there is very, very little here that is new or fresh anymore.",0
" Boiled down to its essentials, F&F is four pretty swell auto-race video games encased in the bloated carcass of a script, by Chris Morgan, that must have been researched in the Archive of Movie Cliches.",0
" At 83 minutes long, The Man is as endless as a bad dream.",0
" Trying to balance her trademark bulldozer comedic style with a little more sweetness, Melissa McCarthy gets part of the way there with this sporadically funny film that has moments of real heart amidst a formulaic redemption story.",0
 Kevin Costner's golfing romance has OK swing but bad form.,0
 Kudos for at least working Claire Danes' glaringly limited abilities into the storyline. Now if they could only do something about the sophomoric script and nasty mysogyny...,0
" Kids might enjoy the cheesy jokes, the shiny gadgets and the pooping dog but for adults it is snooze time all the way.",0
" Predictably, some items planted early in the film ... pop up in the third act with all the subtlety of a blast from Chekhov's gun.",0
" There's no doubt we need more movies for grown-ups, with jokes that don't hit us over the head, but The Men Who Stare at Goats doesn't fit the bill. At best, it might hypnotize you into a stupor.",0
" It looks absolutely amazing, but by the film's middle, we realize it's pretty hollow.",0
" It's a shame about Ray, because Foxx is trapped in a movie that takes the music icon's unique story and turns it into cheesy, sentimental American Dream cliches.",0
" If the results are less satisfying than the previous entries in the trilogy, there's nothing like an [Roy] Andersson film, in which every scene has been painstakingly crafted for maximum visual impact.",1
 Another insult written and directed by women who deserve to be strung up by bridal veils,0
" Commits the cardinal sin for a horror picture by not being scary, but it does earn one accolade -- it could have been worse.",0
" I found this sequel deeply slumping, not to mention unnecessary, unmagical and often unfunny. The misuse of talent is what slumped me the most.",0
" ""Tangerines"" is a modest film, sure of its proportions and clear about its intentions. The key to its effectiveness lies with the actors ...",1
" The film's standardized construction - its focus on lionizing the star's celebrity over her comedy - inevitably turns Radner's zany, effervescent performing energy into a kind of Baba Wawa mush.",0
" If the rest of the movie had put much thought into its characters as it did into that final scene, we'd have really had something.",0
" A classic ""middle"" film that delivers as much excitement and ingenuity you could hope for to outclass hundreds of summer popcorn fare.",1
 The big deal here is Cyrus' first serious [on-screen] kiss. The lip locking is about as romantic as two fish gobbling at the same piece of food.,0

 Jumper is a special effect in search of a movie.,0
" ""Desert Dancer"" is a conventional protest drama, but it offers many magic moments - especially when co-stars Freida Pinto and Reece Ritchie perform sinuous routines. Or simply gaze into each other's eyes.",1
 Even longer and less coherent [than Dead Man's Chest]. Consider it a companion piece to the similarly indulgent Spider-Man 3.,0
" Ultimately, ""Annie"" is so fixated on being current that it will never be more than a passing fancy.",0
 The concept of this performance piece-cum-media interrogation is much stronger than its execution.,0
 There are some fine actors aboard The Commuter ... but they're obliterated amid the carriage carnage and cheap lines. This film is expensive-looking trash.,0

" Female buddy-cop comedy mixes humor, violence, drinking.",1
 Maggie Smith is like Mary Poppins...with a meat ax. Serial Grandmom strikes again.,1

" It's bewildering how sci-fi aficionado Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca,"" ""The Truman Show"") could mastermind such a parasitic mess.",0
" Told from a bright-eyed childlike perspective through Ea's narration, this story of human connection and empathy takes on an animated and lively form that entertains and enlightens in equal measure.",1
" Despite the aspirations of its scrappy hero, it does not stand out among the recent crop of computer-animated features. But it fits in just fine.",1
 Movies rarely need to be made shorter. Addicted to Fresno effortlessly proves that most of them could stand to be longer.,0
" I never know what I want from commercial animated entertainment, but I do know that I like being able to suspect that -- by the standards of the competition -- its makers might be outlaws and lunatics.",1
" It's a wonder that a video game from the 1980s could efficiently set its premise up in a single cut scene, but a major Hollywood production in 2018 can't seem to get beyond mere exposition in its 107-minute running time.",0
" Samberg's fans may enjoy this comedy, but this outsider found it rather limp.",0
" The compelling human moments, like those involving Cheney's protection of Mary and his eventual retraction of that, are often overshadowed by the overly busy choice McKay keeps making.",0
 The action sequences are decent; they just aren't as clever as before.,0
" The new narrative, with its cloying song numbers and an ending lifted from Wall-E, turns Seuss' serious yet still somewhat subtle pro-environmental message into a heavy-handed corporate screed.",0
" A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off.",0
 The throwaway lines in Kay Cannon's script are so many and so expertly deployed that you basically spend the whole movie digging through the trash.,0
" People are always jumping up on tables, bartops, any flat surface available, as if to say 'Who needs nice furniture? Let's scuff the world!'",0
" James McTeigue has a fleet, efficient visual style that keeps the suspense set pieces percolating.",1

" Evening is a slow burner, so slow in fact the credits roll before it ever gets going.",0
" There's an excellent movie in here somewhere - the performances alone are proof of that - but for whatever reason, [Dan] Gilroy's story doesn't click. ",1
" I wanted to laugh. And I often did, but Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping isn't uproariously funny and its cascading series of musical parodies certainly can't touch the winner and still champion mock-doc satire, This is Spinal Tap.",0
 A pro-war movie masquerading as a disaster film? This is the anti Hurt Locker.,1

 There is only one way this could possibly have been entertaining: if Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman had switched roles.,0

" Strike a Pose is very direct and gripping in how it addresses ""the closet"" and the sometimes traumatising emotions it may create.",1
 Cooper extends his streak as the Last Member of the Wedding Crashers Cast Anyone Would've Expected to Achieve Awesomeness But Did and Then Some. He gives a quietly powerful performance that I'm shocked to see hasn't registered on the award-season radar. ,1
" It's still basically The Attack of the Killer Calamari, but without the panache, humour or the lightness of touch that Del Toro brought to it.",0
" Ideology is manifested as empathy, rather than polemic, and the result is a lean, powerful little film that's more about people than politics.",1
 Feels exactly like what it is -- a short stretched out to a feature.,0

 numbed and nonsensical,0
" Those open to other possibilities in cinematic language may marvel at Alonso's ability to hold a viewer rapt through little more than landscape, movement and sound, and ideas that emerge implicitly rather than being directly stated.",1
" Prince Caspian has pretty much something for everyone built into it. Little of it may be exceptional, but much of it goes beyond the usual PG standard in thoughtfulness and craftsmanship as well as carnage.",1

 Does little except reinforce the notion that Allen's creative well has long since run dry.,0
 One of the better Woody Allen films of recent years.,1
" The director's cut still has a pacing that lags during the second act, and now that the film's about the love triangle, the scenes with Julie don't really add anything to the overall story. That being said, it deserves a second chance in its new life.",1
 Eventually you sense that the whole movie is spinning its wheels.,0
" Some of the murders are fantastic, but mostly this feels like nearly identical retread.",0
" From its cringey premise, there was little hope that The Emoji Movie would be anything but awful. The premonition is correct.",0
" Supporting actors Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion have a good punch line or two, but otherwise the book's humor fails to translate with both kids and their parents.",0
 A thoroughly depressing teen farce in which Internet voyeurism has replaced human intimacy and where privacy is *so* 20th century.,0

 You can't blame the actors for this disappointing feature in conception and execution.,0
 This dragon tale goes down in flames.,0

" The film's highlight is the young cast's plausible turns, with the playful interactions among them proving particularly appealing. Their ensemble performances, however, can't even begin to approach remedying the nonsensical shortcomings.",0
 Three food fights and a funeral. ,1
 It's the daily daunting detail that keeps Stronger honest.,1
" There's a great romantic comedy in this material, somewhere, which is too bad, because the movie that did get made is decent if a bit bland.",1
" The most frustrating aspect of The Lovers and the Despot is its refusal to do more than simply recite its tale, ignoring the interesting concepts lurking within it.",0
" From start to finish, It's Kind of a Funny Story walks an uncommonly deft line: Playful comedy gives way to moments of shockingly immediate and honest emotion.",1
" It's [Patrick Downes' and Jessica Kensky's] story, still so unresolved, that hits home the hardest.",1

" Quietly intelligent and respectable, much like its protag.",1
" If The Big Short took the route of slapstick comedy to illuminate a corrupt process, Equity plays it ice-cold.",0
" Floods the senses with dazzling imagery but it reaches overload. Its about not being happy with yourself. Then something extraordinary happens. A scene so unique, so bizarre that it knocks off being eaten by Godzilla. ",0
" Like Attenborough's beard, the new film lacks the buoyancy of its model. Like so many remakes, it is caught between craven homage and uneasy reinvention. And for a celebration of the Christmas spirit, it is oddly gloomy.",0

 A well-intentioned film that isn't a documentary and isn't a very good adventure story.,0

" Eagle vs. Shark might have seemed amusingly original, albeit in a self-consciously quirky, indie-movie kind of way, if Napoleon Dynamite didn't already exist.",0
" Haywood's strengths as a director don't translate to her writing abilities. Pin Cushion is about cruelty above all else, to the exclusion of characterizations.",0
" An intense, zany, manipulative, gorgeously executed mess of a movie, Side Effects is entirely designed to play one big, cruel prank on its audience, a punch Soderbergh delivers with vigorously precise gusto.",1
" Featuring a hilariously bonkers turn from Pattinson, ""Damsel"" upends the Western tropes of hero, villain and damsel-in-distress with a mid-film twist that radically alters our perspective.",1
 The Christmas Chronicles is a deliciously surprising and charming adventure for the whole family. ,1
" Bernie delivers an abundance of belly laughs, but at its center is a confounding act committed by a man too beloved to be hated and a community too passionate to think clearly.",1

 Sullivan Stapleton in his first lead role after Animal Kingdom is actually quite impressive.,1
" According to Steven Soderbergh, ""Side Effects"" is the filmmaker's final feature-length directing credit -- and it shows, partly because this rambling genre exercise, while skillful, offers nothing new.",1
 a grindingly dull western-revenge-supernatural-terrorist-save-the-world mishmash that fails on every level. Did I ask why Megan Fox is here?,0
" This is not a film about narrative sweep, but about the slow, steady business of reclaiming one's soul.",1

 Packs enough of a ka-boom to please the many fans of the action genre.,1
 The ultra-violence of this microcosm [gang] society is what Ghosts is all about.,1
" Kathryn Bigelo has made something horrifying, painful and rage-fueled in Detroit, but this focus on genre aspects undercuts a story meant for larger meanings in the end.",0
" The film..., though focused on a thoroughly modern subculture, lovingly deploys the colour palette of a classic giallo and the sonic stylings of an Eighties slasher.",1
 It is heartening to reflect that the best of Bill Murray may be yet to come.,1
" This is raw and affecting, a real movie rather than fan-con fun.",1
 Jake Szymanski apparently filmed every gag the writers and actors could think of and collated the results into a barely coherent but occasionally funny movie.,0
" It's an interesting conundrum, a mediocre movie whose existence should be celebrated.",0
 This hard-assed film is based on a prison work by Eddie Little. It is only fun to watch in between heists.,1
" This swell stop-motion animation operates on a wavelength similar to that of Laika's debut feature, Coraline, with assured character comedy counterbalanced by a solemn sense of macabre wonder.",1
" While it fascinates to see this force of nature in full flow, Sonia Kronlund's doc fails to fully explore issues that might contradict his self-made image.",1

" You will have no trouble picking out the emotional contours of the movie's tumultuous final scenes, and although Peters holds the drama together, late-game revelations raise narrative questions that are left glaringly unanswered.",0
" The semi-satirical treatment of celebrity culture, as Penelope is treated first as a tabloid sensation then a media darling, is lame and dated.",0
" Director Clooney's decision to shoot a majority of the film in close ups pays big dividends. With nothing else to take away your attention, you are focused on every word...every nuance...every hint of false flattery or earnest appreciation.",1
 Johnny English would most favorably be described as a one-joke action comedy whose one joke wears thin quite quickly (and isn't remotely original to begin with),0
 One of the most poignant responses to a natural catastrophe that Japanese cinema has offered in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.,1
" Your mileage enjoying Brake may vary, but even if you spot the final destination coming, it's a pleasant enough joyride. ",1

" There is a lot of nasty stuff to look at, but very little that is genuinely haunting, jolting or terrifying.",0
 The disputatious and fractured omnibus documentary 11/8/16 nibbles at too many stories in too short a time to make the one great American tale it seems to be aiming for. ,0
" While the Coen Brothers don't show any signs of abandoning movies, Hail, Caesar! shows Hollywood on a precipice, and openly wondering if its followers will remain faithful.",1
" Messy, self-indulgent, intriguing -- but it only really comes alive when it focuses on the competitive 'friendship' of the actor-roommates played by Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman.",1

 Scorsese takes a big gamble with the patience and faith of his audience. ,0
 It's a tough call as to which director's episode is lamer.,0
 It's a fantastic minimalist action film where you actually get to see what is happening.,1

" Part let's-get-it-together band saga and part road movie, the story arc is awfully familiar, but that doesn't stop it being a rollicking romp.",1
 Ben Lawrence's debut documentary is simply remarkable ...but for the sensitivity with which Lawrence tells it.,1
 [The love triangle] plays more like canned heat than blazing inferno...,0
 The film too often stumbles through broad and predictable gags about language and cultural barriers.,0
" Elementary is a very honest and engrossing story that will bring you back to your school days, and its insights will give you great respect for anyone tough and brave enough to choose teaching as a profession.",1
" For the most part this is a tedious, badly written, poorly paced and borderline incoherent thriller that should probably have gone straight to DVD.",0
" Couples, retreat: this movie has the power to make any date feel as endless and soul-sucking as the lifetime's worth of defective, hateful marriages that doom the film's protagonists.",0
" [Catherine] Deneuve and [Catherine] Frot, who are if not at the top of their game, then at least never less than fascinating to observe",1
" It's merely straight-up horror that drops you right into the situation... For me, that's not enough, not when the characters are as uninspiring as this lot.",0
 The film is far from perfect but the end result is effective. [Full review in Spanish],1

 Finally we're seeing Harry (the character and the series) grow up.,1
" With all his devotion to getting the story right -- and that's a worthy goal, don't get me wrong -- Grossman never captures the insanity and terror, or for that matter the seductive allure, of nihilist L.A. punk in its early years.",0
 This unexpectedly charming animation bursts out of the screen with an aesthetic that is a sugar rush of cuteness.,1
" Looking like a low-rent, fraction-of-the-cost cousin to the previous two efforts, the franchise's latest (and hopefully last) entry is muddy-looking, undistinguished, and frustratingly minimal in scope.",0
" If you love movies, see De Palma. Then you need to cue up his films and start watching or re-watching his entire filmography.",1
 Unprecedentedly violent and incomparably preposterous.,0

" Even grading on a curve, Chupacabra vs The Alamo fails to rise to the level of enjoyable stupidity. Better luck next time.",0
" A film about romanticism, respect, acceptance and loyalty, however, it becomes excellent because of the construction of one of the most wonderful characters that modern cinema has given us. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Something horrible happened to the unique movie Osmosis Jones on its way to animation history: The Farrelly Bros. got involved.,0

 This young adult movie is among the dozens of titles featured in the 2015 holiday gift guide at ReelBob.com.,1
 Has no idea what story it wants to sell or the message it wants to say.,0
" There's just not a lot to like here, with the exception of what may be one of the all-time best bad movie lines, one Conan utters to Tamara as a kind of personal credo: ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content."" That makes one of us.",0
" Ms. Weisz consistently pushes the movie deeper, but all too often, the story returns to Philip so that he can fret, swig from a bottle and nurture his paranoia.",0
" As magnificently well crafted as Dunkirk is, it is a film destined to be respected more than it is loved, and given Nolan's record -- I credit him with five great movies -- I call this a highly honorable achievement that nonetheless slightly disappoints.",1
 Should be so much better than it wound up being.,0
" There's not much going on here other than cars. And that's fine, especially since director Cohen doesn't edit his action sequences into MTV-style quick cuts.",1
" A louder, brighter version that's just as empty and even more exhausting.",0
" Their professionalism is palpable, and the young cast, led by Garrett Wareing as Stet, does a good job. None of them, however, can save the movie from its own formulas, which cause it to miss the potential of what it might have been.",0
 Pacino and Mirren's teamwork keeps Phil Spector watchable even when it's dousing itself in dramatic ethanol and lighting a match.,0
" As much as the film is a love poem to Tati's style of comedy, it is also a love poem to the city of Edinburgh. Chomet has turned Scotland into a dreamland, bathed in a radiant, beautiful light.",1

" Chen gives a fairy-tale tone to this ghost story yet always goes deeper into the issues of love, death, trust and envy, loyalty and betrayal.",1
 It's so much more than the murderous mayhem that unfolds onscreen.,1
" Honestly, it is reminiscent of Bruce Banner becoming enraged and turning into The Hulk. Maybe the movie going public will be caught up in all the histrionics. I found it hilariously hokey.",0
" Bay, never one for subtlety, cranks up the sentimentality in his most patriotic film to date.",1
" The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader isn't exactly bad, but it lacks magical resonance and does not make up for it in character depth. ",0

" In the age of media immediacy, well-connected computer systems and helicopter pursuits -- to say nothing of the same watchful government that spawned the Patriot Act -- all this seems nonsensical.",0
" Using superimposition and double-exposure to bring the rickety wagon and its wretched occupants to ghostly life, The Phantom Carriage balances visual poetry with emotional violence.",1
" [Cena] gives good muscle, but Bumblebee brings something even more important - and actually transforming - to the series: a sense of humor, and a heart.",1
" Better than it probably deserves to be. When so many trilogies start strong and finish with a whimper, ""The Hangover"" movies set the bar very low to begin with, and then lower still, just so the only way to go for the finale would be up.",0
" While not top dog of 2016's animal based animation films, The Secret Life of Pets is charming, if not spectacular.",1
 The problem with Triple 9 isn't that it is an uber-masculine piece of genre fiction - it is that it is a formulaic one without a distinctive personality.,0

 Paranormal Activity 3 is an effective and genuinely scary prequel-slash-threequel that effectively expands the story and won't disappoint fans of the first two films.,1
 The final 40-plus minutes are bananas. ,1

" The film is like Jason Bourne fan fiction in how much it completely reworks things we've seen before, only with a few more years of cyberterrorism buzzwords to give viewers the illusion of not just depth but a plot. ",0
" Although this is just more of the same old same, Halloween 4 is directed with some skill by B-movie specialist Dwight H. Little.",0
" The clever camera moves and inventive uses of stagecraft feel like sound and fury, signifying nothing.",0
" An enjoyable, occasionally laughable, and sometimes moving drama, with Emma Thompson on fine brittle form as the quintessentially English Australian who gave the world its most famous nanny.",1
" ""Andre the Giant"" can't get its hands around the subject matter, but what it does accomplish is a rich understanding of Roussimoff's temperament, loneliness, and megafame as a WWF titan.",1
" Just my opinion, but I think that most people have read the book and will see the movie out of a sense of cynicism and doubt of the teachings of the church, and not because they make for quality entertainment.",0

" Belies the inexperience of its makers, for it's a substantial, deeply moving film that has the potential to captivate audiences everywhere.",1
" Crispin Glover sings the closing credits version of ""Ben."" It's hard to imagine a more sinister, more perfect interpretation of this most uncanny of tunes.",1
" The director, who admits to having killed a man on his own tour of duty, is painting a portrait of an utterly hopeless, chaotic and morally compromised scenario in which nobody wins.",1

 Not genuinely funny enough to be anything more than a silly slapstick comedy without much stick to slap. ,0
" There's such a gaping discontinuity between her physical beauty and her vacant, gum-snapping personality that she's like a walking advertisement for everything that's right and wrong with America.",0

 Jake Gyllenhaal passes his weirdness to Naomi Watts in this film. Great performances. [Full review in Spanish],1
" Barnyard moves with a frenetic energy, especially in the numerous barn dance and chase scenes, that will probably keep family audiences moderately entertained. But it doesn't stand up to this summer's relative bonanza of animated family films. Moo.",0

 It's such a handsomely mounted and well-acted piece that few serious cinema-goers are likely to mind the circuitous path it takes in getting there.,1
" A chilling reminder that a simple life is no shield against the disastrous or the devastating, and that the parent-child relationship is at least as essential to the parent as it is to the child.",1
" The script abandons ideas like comic timing and, well, common sense.",0
" Wavers between tepid star turns and a Romeo and Juliet subplot involving an al Qaeda assassin and the daughter of the lead inquisitor -- a story that's ridiculous even broken up and bookended as it is here, to give this flat movie a trick ending.",0

 Hirschbiegel's troubled remake has several good scenes and is by no means a disaster but it's ultimately disappointing thanks to poor editing and clumsy writing.,0
" An exquisite celebration of language, life and love.",1

 It's Carey Mulligan's ivy-league performance that really puts the film in a class all by itself.,1
 Johnson has the acting chops for this more dramatic fare and the story is exciting and thought-provoking.,1
 Jack Reynor (future star) ably carries the movie until Collette intermittently pops up to seize the camera and devour her desperate son's entire life force.,1
" I'm not the right audience for this film, but then again neither are some 16,000 readers at the Internet Movie Database who gave it a cumulative rating of 5.7 out of 10. I think a few 21 & Unders might have pushed it up a few points.",0
 Excruciatingly intense and prone to explosions of violence.,1

 Michelle Pfeiffer's entrancing performance is more than capable of commanding people to watch.,1
 Duly drenched in Gothic atmosphere but disastrously drained of any solid suspense.,0

" Stark, violent Spanish drama about solitary trapper. ",1

 Dangerous Liaisons among rich NYC teens.,1
" Jackson and his usual screenwriting collaborators...have simplified and amplified Sebold's text, turning it from a meditation on the interior politics of family into a supernatural revenge story.",0
 Any movie based on Battleship that doesn't at least throw in a PT boat isn't worthy of the name.,0
" Death Race... delivers the goods on tongue-in-cheek action, simplistic yet effective social commentary, and a bunch of actors who clearly get the tone of the piece, and are willing to go way over the top in silly, campy, and sometimes ultra-violent fun.",1
 Angst-riddled yet assured debut by third-generational filmmaker Gia Coppola.,1

 Paul Dano seemingly lacks any real charisma of his own; it's not that he disappears into these roles but that these roles disappear when he steps into them. ,0

 ...engaging material with brisk pacing and breezy style... [Includes cast and director interviews],1
" That the movie works so well is also due to the exceptional talents of leads Simonischek and Huller, who hold nothing back - especially the former, whose Winfried is one of the oddest ducks in recent movies.",1
" The plot snakes and forks like a mountain road, because it doesn't have anywhere important to go.",0
 It makes for half-baked drama.,0
" Bizarrely, its biggest flaw lies with casting. Carrell is too familiar to convince as a Lothario, Buscemi looks vaguely lost, while Carrey is too long in the tooth. ",0

 Not since Thomas O'Malley got that wanderlust in Disney's The Aristocats (1970) has the life of a street cat seemed so idyllic.,1
 One compelling story intertwined gracelessly with countless others ranging from mediocre to unspeakably idiotic.,0
" The wordless way that they click suggests a sexual telepathy, there's real tenderness in their sounds and movements, and the characters seem to be having a really good time-which is still something of a rarity when it comes to sex in art cinema.",1
" It's a fun enough movie, though it never quite hits the levels of its predecessor.",1
 Refreshing and bracing but increasingly murky the longer you stay in the water...,1
" I don't think adding realism to every superhero story is the right way to go. It worked for THE DARK KNIGHT, but just because that was successful doesn't mean you need to do that for every character from a comic book. ",0
" It would have been funnier if, instead of Pegg, his frequent collaborator, Nick Frost had taken the role. Then we would have a film worthy of its name. And maybe even a few more genuine guffaws.",0
" Ferrell seems to be running on empty, despite a luxuriant McEnroe afro-with-headband and a past as a one-hit wonder (""Love Me Sexy"").",0

 The appropriate degree of festive atmosphere on the part of the spectator can translate into a fun experience. [Full review in Spanish],1
" If there's still the sense that Ashby isn't as sanctified as American New Wave stalwarts Coppola or Scorsese, Amy Scott's breezy tribute of a documentary is out to correct that oversight.",1
" Onstage, there was so much glamour I couldn't decide whom to concentrate on. In the movie, they're so obnoxious I just wanted them to shut up and go home. The movie is busy, but in their failed homage to Fellini, they've lost his mystery and humor.",0
" It's all quite deeply moving, and if you remain untouched by the end credits, you have some self-examination of your own to do.",1
" Cronenberg seems like he has something specific, possibly devilishly satiric in mind, but his screen instincts are numb, constructing a feature that lurches from scene to scene.",0
 Few other films have depicted so acutely the crushing disillusionment and infinite hope of growing up.,1

 Too pure to be pink.,1
" Forest Whitaker turns in one of his sleepiest performances; no one else seems to be trying very hard either, yet director Olivier Megaton delivers some good chases, fist fights, and shots of Neeson looking glum.",0

" In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end. ",1
" Maybe this title is to Jackie Chan as Moonraker was to James Bond, an extravagant attempt to imitate the box office fare of its time, which only highlighted the throwback quality of the central character. It's a ""jump the shark"" moment.",0
" Despite some legitimate signs of life, Evolution isn't fit enough to survive.",0
 Weitzman hits all the book's plot points without ginning up any of its corresponding emotion. ,0
" Not all of Oblivion's big ideas stick - in fact some of them threaten to send the film spiralling into its namesake - but at its best, the film achieves something that is highly elusive in modern film: it is completely and utterly engrossing.",1

" It's a film made with serious purpose and serious skill but so utterly, irredeemably geeked out on itself that you simply cannot take it seriously - not if you want to get the most out of it.",1
" Stylish, witty and beautifully shot, though very much from the viewpoint of charming robber Forrest; a thief with a gun is still a thief with a gun. Spacek and Redford delight; I never believed in the relationship between Forrest and the cop on his tail.",1
 It has an enviable level of clarity and plausibility while dynamically satisfying the conventions and requirements of the thriller.,1
" Evil Dead lacks the humor and sub-genre-launching power of the original, but it's a solid remake that is definitely worth watching, even and especially if you are a fan of the original.",1
 Ronit's complexity never fully comes across in the film...,0
 I think the women are extraordinary.,1
 I confess: I fast-forwarded through most of it.,0
" The script won't win any stars for originality, it's all put across with enough sincerity to make the corn easy to swallow.",1
" Fast-moving, funny, exciting warp-speed entertainment and, heaven help me, even quite moving - the kind of film that shows that, like it or not, commercial cinema can still deliver a sledgehammer punch. It sure didn't feel like a trek to me.",1
" Understands desire as something ravenous, terrifying and ridiculous.",1
" It's better than the last film, The World Is Not Enough, but it doesn't really recapture the old vim and vigor.",0
 This film is full of self-referential humor. [Full review in Spanish],1
 Tom Cruise's latest action spectacular is so dull that I found myself willing on the baddies.,0

" Basically, don't put too much thought into this movie, because no one involved in making it did.",0
" I appreciate [Reeves'] interest and passion on the subject, and his interview style is fine -- the conversations he finds himself engaged in with the Wachowski's especially is worth watching it for alone.",1
" Some movies are so good, the only thing that disappoints is that they are not great.",1
" There's a whole galaxy out there, but Ron Howard doesn't seem to realise it. His Han Solo prequel is a pedestrian journey through a series of inconsequential set-pieces, where character development of its iconic protagonist is stuck to the surface.",0

 This intelligent and original film is a prime example of the great films truly indie directors can make. ,1

" Does Love the Coopers's collection of what are essentially short films that tie together at the end for family uplift equal good? Oh, who am I kidding? No. Of course not.",0

 Sets up such a pretense of intellectualism it fools its audience into believing it's on a plane they can't understand...,0
" Marshall, Hanks, and his co-stars seldom put a foot wrong.",1
" My patented scientific method for objectively judging comedy reveals a favorable chuckle-to-groan ratio, one dozen solid out-and-out laughs, and four roll-out-of-your-seat moments of uncontrollable hilarity.",1
" Despite its all-star cast, Big Stone Gap falls short of what it aims to be: the next great love story. There are a few notable comedic moments, however, and fans of big screen romances may find the journey worthwhile.",0
" Never approaches the rolling boil its title suggests, and laugh for laugh, it's the least successful comedy the Farrelly Brothers have made.",0
" As tired as this plot may sound -- a gangster/family man sees a therapist because of his middle-age 'stress' -- Bromell imbues the premise with added dimension, raising the bar for similar stories.",1
" It's plain and uncondescending in its re-creation of what it means to be a high-school athlete, of what a country dance hall is like, of the necking in cars and movie houses, and of the desolation that follows high-school graduation.",1
" Like any good work of popular culture, Rob Reiner's film of Stephen King's best-selling book Misery functions on more than one level.",1
" 'The World's End' is really about the dangers of nostalgia and how you can never truly go home again, even if there hasn't been an alien invasion.",1
" An actor most at home playing devilish, Keaton's got the last-reel Machiavellian shrug down cold. But neither he nor the filmmakers do much to illuminate the neural pistons fired from brain to bodily shrug.",0
 A fun idea turns into a so-so comedy thanks to an unappealing hero and variable performances from the well-known cast.,0
" The main character makes an engaging guide as well as a humorous one, and putting the process in the foreground helps to make it a film that's highly entertaining even in its more familiar, or least fruitful, sections.",1
 The movie misses the opportunity to exploit the comedic chemistry between it's leads. [Full review in Spanish],0
 This neatly written Heathers-meets-Groundhog Day high-concept package delivers both technical polish and a toothsome yet likeable cast.,1

 Classic '80s send-up of Canada; lots of beer drinking. ,1
" This has always been a show about the broads, and how they torment, tantalize, judge and revere the suffering mama's boy. The best way to approach Nine is as a fashion spread rather than an actual story.",0
 Low-budget undersea adventure is boring and lifeless. ,0
" Expectations are high for the film, Wiig, and directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (of the innovative American Splendor) -- and the result, disappointing.",0

 Miyazaki once again takes the breath away with his bizarre imagination and richly painted scenes.,1
 A crisp piece of entertainment.,1

 A painterly act of contemplation and one to compare with any of the greatest films made about the nature of faith.,1
" This is a thoughtful, affecting film, filled with absorbing characters.",1
" It's only as strong as its overstuffed and overexaggerated source material, and you get the sense the film would have been improved with even more diversion from the book. After all, it's not exactly a case of adapting a true story.",1
" A Piece of Work is a refreshing look at a reluctant legend, one who's still using all her might to break barriers for the rest of us to get a real kick out of.",1
 I have not seen any of the two previous films by Krasinski but at least here it is more than clear that we are facing a real filmmaker.,1
 The movie inspired three sequels and remains undeniably frightening. It also marks a significant step in the evolution of modern science-fiction films.,1

" When the most sympathetic character in the movie is a potential suicide bomber, you know something's wrong.",0
" The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again.",1

 It's all done expertly and with an unexpectedly deft sleight-of-hand twist in the homestretch that proves once again that Kormakur is the kind of overachieving director that one pigeonholes at their own risk.,1
 The comedic equivalent of being whomped in the face with a pillowcase full of nickels.,0
" The Birdcage grossed nearly $200 million worldwide in 1996, and that is significant. Box Office Mojo says it's the highest grossing queer film of all time, though they're not counting Frozen and 300, and they probably should. ",1
" At times you tune out of what's actually going on, hypnotized by the swimming camera, but in the end the movie is interesting both as a movie and as an experiment.",1
" Bobby doesn't get everything right but when Estevez allows his images and the reality of his characters do the talking, the film works with indelible cogency.",1

" Jason Statham has become a kind of poor man's James Bond but if you're expecting a coherent plot, forget it. There isn't one. Just action sequences that often lack continuity.",0

" 'God is punishing me,' says the matriarch. Not just you.",0

 A sex-toy Pinocchio? Offenbach's Olympia as an inflatable courtesan? If only.,0

" Burrell doesn't quite capture the wry deadpan of the original, but then, neither does the movie. That's okay.",1
 Other than one great scene in a children's cancer ward -- which shows us what Foster can do with Armstrong's slippery charm and ambiguous motivations -- there's nothing in The Program that we don't already know.,0

" Were there an award for the most encouraging start to a movie which then turns out to be a crashing disappointment, Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets would be a strong nominee.",0
" Aimless plot, no real sense of purpose...it wastes a talented cast.",0
" Tired, aggravatingly vociferous stuff, with an insatiable improvisational thirst that makes a perfectly agreeable premise look like an audition tape for The Groundlings.",0
" If the story is a smidge predictable, at least the movie is pleasingly old-fashioned and grown-up, with a '90s paranoid-thriller vibe.",1
" A dialectic, aesthetic and ideological battle with irreconcilable factions at this point. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" A great little film, in which Riley Keough and Jena Malone before respond with a heartfelt performance. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" If you get stuck at Striptease, my advice is to relax and try to enjoy its occasional pleasures.",0
" It goes about its task with inspiration and heart, helping to bridge the gaps between its ambitions and its budget.",1
" Even though The Amina Profile works as a cyber-thriller of sorts, I think it's much more wide-reaching than that, a story about online identity, but also about the danger of media-constructed narratives.",1
" Perhaps the most encouraging part of Moana's feminism is its subtlety. It presents female agency as nothing out of the ordinary - it doesn't comment on it, there is no patriarchy she's fighting back against and there's no love story. ",1
" What elegant pulp this is, and how inelegantly I gobbled it up.",1
" ""Retribution"" has actually got some very decent action and 3D effects. The story is still razor-thin. But, by the end of it all, I was ready for the next sequel, the presumed finale.",1
" There's no heart, and I don't put it simply on the visuals that almost look real at times. Amazing 3D is the only thing this dark version does really well.",1
 Charles Darwin is such a polarizing figure that trying to make a credible portrait of him is almost impossible. I'm willing to give director Jon Amiel ('Entrapment') credit for at least trying.,0
" This feels like a middling 80s action film supposedly amped up by being set in Paris, but instead dumbed down by daft story telling.",0
" Batman lives to absorb blame in order to save the worthy, and soldier (or speedbike) on.",1
" Rich animation, with layer upon layer of dense jungle; lively, well-developed characters; skilled voice talent; a driving, compact story; and Phil Collins' robust songs.",1
" It has very little to do with the novel by Lewis Carroll. Indeed, it's so bizarre and different that you may feel you've gone through the looking glass yourself.",0
 A wildly contrived but pleasantly frothy romcom about a youngish single woman on an urgent search for Mr Right.,1
" Think of this movie as a greatest-hits package, with some good stuff to show but nothing very new to say.",1
 Some of the stories are genuinely affecting. But Gomes' arcane storytelling style and frequent use of absurdity will require a good deal of patience from filmgoers.,1
 Surfer is just as lousy on every level as its predecessor.,0
" Most often in its early stages, the melodrama onscreen edges precipitously close to dissolving into a puddle of platitudinous pabulum served in the manner of a rote Sunday school lesson.",0

" A bearable bawdy pro-feminist comedy, even if it had no emotional impact on me and the comedy rushed by me as it makes its way to its target audience.",1
" A canny blend of Heart of Darkness with the grandeur of an old Hollywood biblical epic, peppered with some intense set pieces.",1
" Like executing a gravity-defying trick, you can't overthink things ... This film, unfortunately, doesn't land the trick. Nor does it fall too hard, though.",1
 There's no larger message other than that greed gives us something to hold on to even as it kills us.,1
 A sorry excuse for a musical biopic.,0
" As far as practical effects go, Graveyard Shift is an underappreciated treat for gorehounds.",1
 Poltergeist (1982) did it first and did it better. But this new stroll through cinematic static is still a sometimes spooky spin on that theme.,0
" A very unappealing animated feature about Babe Ruth, baseball, and family values.",0
" It uses empathy as a weapon against the audience, forcing them to confront this aspect of our culture in all its ugliness. It's unshakeable, as it should be.",1
" It's a team sport, but the story belongs to the individual, which gives the otherwise comfortable corniness of Mr. 3000 its meta-celebrity subtext.",0
" By keeping its focus admirably tight, the sober and sobering Israeli documentary ""The Law in These Parts"" presents a devastating case against the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.",1
 Adam's disorder is but one piece of a tender relationship puzzle that's nurtured out of its shell by the performers.,1
" The final half hour of Suspiria suggests there's a brash, mad movie buried somewhere under all this pretense, one that could have rivaled Mandy for most-[crazy]-fun movie of the year.",0
" If spot-on satirical thrillerThe Day Shall Come presents how members of the law enforcement community behave, America is screwed.",1
" The audiovisual section is interesting and Nicolas Cage is acceptable, but this is not enough to compensate for the amount of excesses, whims and inconsistencies that the story presents. [Full review in Spanish]",0
" The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.",0

" Call it Amazing, Spectacular, Superior...all of the Spidey adjectives apply and still aren't enough.",1
" More than a featurette or biography, it's a companion piece that shows precisely how real people can be heroes right alongside the fictional ones they create, just by learning how to be themselves and living that truth.",1
 One of the year's most entertaining and enriching nonfiction films...Moving and joyful.,1
 Never really digs deep enough into the brilliant and often enigmatic title character. Begs for a documentary treatment.,0
 This film will probably enjoy many critical accolades and award nominations for its talented leading ladies and their flawless performances.,1
" The Coen Brothers should stop collaborating on comedies with George Clooney. None has worked, and none less so than this leaden spy game. At least Brad Pitt is the loosest he's cut in years, emerging as a potential go-to guy for future Coen comedies.",0
" The actresses are so wasted, they're even demoted to fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth billing under every one of the dudes. At least the guys aren't having fun either.",0
 This feathered pastiche of PoW classics such as The Great Escape and Stalag 17 is an awesome achievement by consummate film-makers.,1
" If you're a parent who ever, for one cold-sweat second, lost sight of your child at a playground - ""The Tall Man"" will tap into your darkest fears. And then make them even darker.",1
" Tim Story's film wears you down until you relent and say, yes, I like these people and it's fun to watch them all have such a good time.",1
 Boom for Real sheds new light on an already well-mythologized era.,1
" This is one of those layered, fairly plotless and enigmatic films that comes into sharper focus as it goes along.",1
 The cast includes numerous formidable talents... But they're all stuck trying to fill out two-dimensional roles in a directorial package heavier on generic professional gloss than conviction.,0
" So overlong and random that it spoils a mesmerizing lead performance and an appreciation for how big a deal with this artist/designer was, at his peak. ",0
" The Jungle Movie maintains Hey Arnold!'s warm tone and careful pacing, its willingness to let its young characters absorb dramatic moments and contemplate within silences.",1
" If anything, this Canadian production misses a great opportunity to dig into its setting and examine the dark side of seemingly pristine Toronto, even as the script by Elan Mastai and director David Weaver labors over a mostly boilerplate storyline.",0
" In the end, Danger Diva doesn't really do it.",0
" if you haven't seen any of them - why not see this one? It's crazy fun for less than two hours ... It's all very tonally specific, and the tone is bonkers. But it's so intriguing, and everyone looks so good ... the guiltiest pleasure of the year.",1
" ""Goon"" was a keeper. The perhaps prophetically named ""Last"" isn't exactly 101 minutes in the penalty box, but it's a disappointing throwaway.",0
" It's the kind of processed-cheese tearjerker, completely devoid of shame, that can harden even the easiest criers into heckling cynics. You want to take its lunch money or at least introduce it to better music.",0
" A tougher work might have seemed provocatively relevant in the tragic context of current events, but this film has a muted nostalgia for the days when bomb-tossing students had easy-to-pronounce names and might grow up to be as cleancut as Robert Redford.",0
" Inevitably, the film is a jumble sale, but you can make some nice discoveries.",1
 Johnny Depp does his best but the script gives him no possible way to present a fully fleshed out character,0
" In the dire The Master of Disguise, Carvey is seen to maximum disadvantage as a dim-witted Italian-American waiter whose family have an inherited gift for turning themselves into anyone from Bo Derek to George Bush.",0
" You can almost see the writers (Ellroy, Kurt Wimmer - creator of sci-fi mish-mash Ultraviolet - and first-timer Jamie Moss) charging at one another with false antlers in a challenge to come up with the toughest soundbite.",0
" It dares to diverge from the current culture of cinema by opting for a small scale, an open heart, and a sincere interest in the lives of small-town Americans.",1
" Locy infuses the film with empathy and wit, and his grandly bittersweet imagination pulls the story toward tragedy, but he also plays loosely with stereotypes better left behind.",1
" Submarine successfully combines the quirky and the sweet, in this representation of adolescence in all of its messy, overdramatic, and bumbling glory. ",1
" Stewart is a strangely compelling stand-in for our millennial anxieties. But her pitchless speech is even more monotonous than usual, and there's something numbingly interchangeable about all the people and events in the director's coldly sumptuous world.",0
 A stylish energy sustains this film even when it begins to drift into draggy incoherence.,0
" For all the spectacle, it is more abstract than involving and the film never pumps with the blood of romantic passion that flows through so many Powell movies.",1
" It's silly the way hope, optimism and love are silly: silly and rather wonderful.",1
" Gory, disgusting and stupid. ... But, heaven help me, it's entertaining.",0
" Kunis and McKinnon don't exactly set the screen on fire with their chemistry, and there are only the most perfunctory shadings to their characters.",0

 The verdict is in: Conviction is a standard but stirring legal drama.,1
" Add ""Drive Angry"" to the long list of Tarantino-knock-off films. ",0
 The movie is as lumpy and misshapen as a giant booger.,0
 A little gem for both guitar heads and lovers of old New York.,1
" Though there's a real monster terrorizing Seoul, a giant, hairless thing that looks like a 700-foot boiled cat, we spend Colossal with our human beast. In her hungover eyes, we see horror and empathy: What did I destroy last night?",1
" To understand von Trier one must accept Gregory of Nazianzus's explanation of the ascetic doctrine as ""the pleasure of no pleasure.""",1
" It's tricky, given the current political climate, to glorify an eco-terrorist, but Geirharosdottir enables Erlingsson to pull it off with her ability to remain likable in the face of Halla's escalating criminal activity.",1
" It's the Die-Hard-in-the-White-House scenes that are the real stars - tightly framed and quickly paced scenes of mayhem, murder and hand-to-hand combat as an on-his-own Tatum tries to save the day.",1
" the film's ethical structure is not hammered onto the narrative, but rather flows effortlessly out of it, merging story and theme in ways that are both exciting and deeply touching",1
 What makes The Lookout such a surprise - and such a joy - is that it runs wild across multiple genres.,1
" Blunt manages to give her sad and messy character some humanity through smudged mascara and puffy lips, but the mechanical screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson doesn't give her -- or the others -- much room to develop beyond ciphers. ",0
" The narrative is not well structured, and Streep's performance suffers as a result.... The scenes with Broadbent are the best. They just aren't worth sitting through a history lesson that isn't taught well.",0
" It sounds like a straight-to-DVD stinker doesn't it? It's pleasantly surprising to report therefore, that Doghouse isn't one of the worst films of the year and is in fact a hilarious, PC brigade-baiting romp.",1
" ""The Desolation of Smaug"" turns to be more of too much of a good thing.",0
" This fails to achieve anything special or spectacular and what we're left with is a rather run-of-the-mill, albeit more raunchy and definitely enjoyable, tale of opposites attracting.",1
 A surreal and haunting procedural.,1
 It should be seen for its undeniably brilliant elements.,1
" It's refreshing to see a film set amid the daily life of an impoverished, rural immigrant community. It's a shame the only aspect of the social world that is explored is the sexual exploits of a few teens.",0
" Morris, whose previous work includes the remarkable The Thin Blue Line and The Fog of War, does not hesitate to provoke.",1
" A subdued portrayal of youthful idealism, even with surging hormones",0
" Funnier than Wenders' version, and it also succeeds in visualising LA as a magical city while dealing intelligently with the themes of mortality, sacrifice, free will, and the mixed blessings of the human condition.",1
" Stylish, cinematically lush and well-acted by its gorgeous three leads.",1
 A well-intentioned but ultimately disappointing film that is perhaps afraid of its own subject.,0
" This true story is, in itself, so tragically fascinating and the performances so fine, you almost don't realize how safe this film actually is.",1
" conceals beneath its breezy sentimentality a dream-like narrative complexity that you may find yourself pleasantly unravelling for some time afterwards, as you revisit its scenarios from the twin perspectives of a child and an adult.",1
" It might have been better if it had gotten zanier; instead, it's rather staid and un-risky - until the end, when it takes a turn that might have been effective if it hadn't come out of nowhere. ",1
 Manages to come across as both too fizzy for its own good and too flat to be believed.,0
" You, Me and Dupree, a houseguest-from-hell tale, is an amiable comedy, but patched together from the plots of so many other movies, recent and otherwise, as to create a distracting sense of deja vu throughout.",0
" Samuel Maoz's Foxtrot toys with our emotions, but that doesn't mean it lacks any of its own. This is an energetic and structurally audacious jukebox of sensations, prioritising impulse over precision and thought over action.",1
" David Gordon Green seems to have used this template as some sort of experiment... Green's method is like a stone-cold killer in a John Woo movie: He makes us laugh, then immediately shoots us in the face.",1
" Niccol's attention to detail perks up the screenplay, and constantly strengthens the ideas that he's frantically trying to communicate.",1
 At best a sporadically amusing sketchbook of theater types.,0

" If you liked the first film, then seeing these characters over a decade later, involved in the same silly set-ups will be pretty entertaining.",1
 Stuff the cork back in: This wine movie was sold before its time.,0
 Beautifully designed but short on depth or novelty.,0
" About as funny as Ross on ""Friends."" David Schwimmer (Ross on ""Friends"") directs.",0
 What is intended as haunting and unworldly comes off as stilted and phony. Only the evocative cinematography of Robert Humphreys gives any hint as to what may have been.,0
 Director John M. Chu's film is a blur of CGI trickery that bears zero weight because it's impossible for ticket holders to suspend their disbelief without sacrificing their intelligence for two hours.,0
" If you're okay with standard slasher flicks and you enjoy grandiose special effects, then House of Wax might be worth a trip to the theater for you. If not, wait for the DVD.",0
" Soggy, often silly romantic melodrama",0
" Nothing to write home about, but still a middling hoot",1
" It's really only for the Ab Fab loyal, but if you're a sweetie darling, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is a satisfying trip back into Patsy and Edina's self-obsessed world.",1
 An extraordinary documentary-using footage shot from inside the Kremlin-that explores Putin's uncompromising thirst for power.,1
" Somber but not humorless, ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" plays to a languid but involving rhythm that is its own.",1
" The film is ultimately let down by repetitive action sequences, some appalling dialogue and a deeply unpleasant streak of violent misogyny.",0
" While Byzantium brings a dark sexiness back to the vampire genre, a stale story sucks out what life Neil Jordan is able to create while adapting Buffini's script.",0
" The eye candy is still tasty, but Sicario: Day of the Soldado would be far more nourishing if it gave the heart and the mind the same gratification it bestows on the eyes.",0
 Possibly the most excruciating comedy of the year.,0
" Poignant, but shot through with welcome touches of humor, it opens a door to an unfamiliar culture, and does so with honesty and heart.",1
" Is the story, and its heroine's fate, a fairy tale or a delusion? If the former, the movie is as sweet as a Disney-inspired anime. If the latter, Kumiko is deeply sad.",1
 A colossal waste of time that never quite musters up any enthusiasm or depth in its duration.,0
" Nolan has conjured a bold mix of thriller and period piece, with even a precocious dab of science fiction. ",1
 It conveys a credible sense of Ailes's psychology through the testimony of peers and co-workers who witnessed his ruthlessness firsthand.,1
 To say that The Last isn't daring in its approach would be an understatement...,1
 Nothing short of a triumph.,1
 It's [director Ryan] Coogler's personal touches and vision that elevate Creed from the ordinary. ,1

" As male guilt and vengeance fantasies go, Derailed has its moments of righteous comeuppance.",1
" ""Salma,"" the British-made documentary about an Indian poet, never feels like an outsider's portrait of another culture.",1
" Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" last year's off-brand Marvel hit, ""Ant-Man"" dabbles in the bright, playful colors of the superhero spectrum, reveling in moments of cartoonish whimsy and smirky humor.",1
 It seems that the only legitimate attack that is made on Bond's character comes from his male enemies.,0
 It's actually quite moving and Barnz finds the right emotional touch points without going overboard.,1
 Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain doesn't aim for thrills but gut-wrenching reality in recreating the events of that horrific day.,1
 Definitely worth seeing because of exciting scenes with Smith and Voight sparring verbally as Ali and Cossell.,1
 Beautifully shot and subtly persuasive.,1
 We forget that behind the blockbuster trappings and fan hysteria there is actually some fine moviemaking to be found. And director David Yates captures much of the book's heart.,1
 The film is driven more by its concept than by its plot but it's still a fun summer film.,1
" Even if a good heist/grift movie struggles in places, a good payoff will still make it work and that is definitely the case here.",1
" It is a tragedy, yes, but a very human one, with an overall caustic, almost nihilistic absurdity running throughout.",1
" It's a worthy cause and an honorable film, the first full-length Disney cartoon with an African-American heroine. But without a strong story, it's a case of one step forward and two steps back.",0
" If the glue holding Crash's arcs together was Paul Haggis's belief in the power of racism, this time it's love. ",0
" Stellar performances have difficulty breaking through the excruciatingly glum cycle of addiction, recovery and relapse.",0
" The trouble with this satirical take US involvement in Iraq, penned by Mark Leyner, John Cusack and Jeremy Pikser, is that the real thing is equally absurd and only marginally less funny.",0
 A pretentious mess.,0
" It's not clever, but it is big.",1
 True-story medical tale is made shallow and sentimental.,0
" Exquisitely crafted if somewhat academic - an ""ambient thriller"", if there's such a thing.",1
" ...makes this film pale against Clooney's ""Ocean"" trilogy. Heck, even the great 60s version with Frank Sinatra was more fun. The difference is that those films had set characters that did not act the same",1
 Can a marriage crumble gently?,1

 A rare misfire for the usually reliable Lee.,0
 A gentle wake-up call for reviewers who see themselves as movie gatekeepers rather than movie analysts.,1
" Haneke (""Funny Games,"" ""Cache,"" ""The Piano Teacher,"" ""White Ribbon"") has tackled a difficult subject that is unpleasant to watch, more unpleasant to think about. But the 70 year-old filmmaker has done it with taste, discretion and sympathy. ",1
" With a loving and playful tone, this documentary shows a much richer reality, closer to anyone's daily struggles while questioning our ability to look beyond bodies, prejudices and media education. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Cameron Crowe casts a heart-warming cinematic spell that will milk many a tear from its widespread target audience. ,1
" [Lights Out is] shot largely in the dark. Sadly, the potholes in the narrative leave the audience stuck there, too.",0
" Bob Fosse's direction is as chaotic as it was in his previous Sweet Charity, a desperate scramble after a style.",0
" Prince Avalanche is a slow burn and it does grow on you over time, but despite the central pair sharing undoubted chemistry, the movie's dialogue isn't as riveting as it needed to be and it inevitably feels a little flat.",0
 The storytelling is unfussy but still implies backstory and emotional connections that take a while to become clear.,1
" As with ""Cars,"" the world of ""Planes"" feels safe. A little too safe, perhaps.",0
" There is absolutely no sense of danger ... for that matter, there's little urgency at all to answering what should have been the story's primary question.",0
" This 'Braveheart'-like reenactment of a Civil War uprising by a swamp-squatting commune of poor whites and escaped slaves, led by proto-socialist Newton Knight, is rather good. ",1
" While the film attempts to put its own spin on the story for the digital age, Bahrani's film does not measure up to the source material.",0
" Makes for a narrative with little consistent forward momentum and an anticlimactic ending, though the film remains agreeable thanks largely to Rush's flavorful performance.",1
" Slick as the polished marble surfaces of its locations-museums, high-end restaurants, posh living rooms and offices-L'Amant Double steadily disappears down a whirlpool of kinky sex, melodramatic mystery, and thriller bombast.",1
" With Louis Jourdan as the bored playboy, Maurice Chevalier a delight as the ageless Gallic rake and Leslie Caron radiating her sunny gamin charm as Gigi.",1
" Ghost in the Shell is a largely humourless affair that draws from the usual reference points, not least Blade Runner.",0
 ...the only touch of humanism in this film comes from Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany. [Full Review in Spanish] ,0
" Mike Myers' latest character ""Guru Pitka"" borders on self-parody: a lovable clown peddling services of questionable value in a quest for self-fulfillment.",0
" Stands in marked contrast to many of the heavily-improvised bro comedies of the last few years, actually taking time over its comic bits rather than just throwing every rambling, shambling improv routine up on the screen.",1
" The movie doesn't come close to the humor and heart of [Illumination's] summer hit, The Secret Life of Pets.",0
" Even in this conglomerate era of marketed, predigested mediocrity, this Disney movie slips instantly into the humdrum",0
" In the words of Kurt Russell's FBI maverick, Mr Nobody: ""Rule number one. Know your audience."" The powers-that-be certainly know us.",1
" Witty and wilfully wacky, this offbeat adventure is good fun to watch, even if we can never quite get in sync with its peculiar rhythms.",1
 The Zookeeper's Wife undersells a story of Warsaw torment in favor Chastain's - albeit more than formidable - performance.,0
" Compelling, mature portrait of a musician as a young man.",1
" Decidedly cheesy, and let down by disappointing action sequences, a script that's full of half-baked ideas, and an over-reliance on CGI-heavy effects.",0
" Footnote is lighthearted in tone -- which is key to its success, even though it deals with serious family issues and also spotlights the stubbornness and hypocrisy of academic world.",1
" Given that this movie has appeared on my list of anticipated movies for the past three years, I was thoroughly ready for this film. And color me ecstatic that my faith was rewarded.",1
" Though informative, [it does] little more than pile up in the waste bin of my cinema-going life.",0
" The technology and performances that bring the apes to life make the film a must-see for any modern movie fan, but it's the emotion and humanity of Caesar's story that makes the film a must-see for any movie fan at all.",1
 The only element in 21 that saves the film from being a dreary coming-of-age story grafted onto a two-hour commercial for the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Bureau is Spacey.,0
" Goblet again serves up a delicious who's who of British acting, with hilarious contributions from newcomers Brendan Gleeson as instructor Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter.",1
 The ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense.,0
" Refreshingly well-done, with plenty of action and romance to thrill younger audiences, and a nice mix of old and new dramatic -- as well as historic -- elements to interest the older folk who've seen it all before.",1
 The Lovely Bones is an uneven offering with under-written characters that alters some of the book's better moments with no real rewards.,0
" The Ungli gang's vigilantism is never grand until the climax, and by then you may be past caring. ",0
" McDonald's film ultimately boils down to being just another competent but slightly dull prison doc, albeit a toe-tapping one.",0
" Far more serious than either the broad trailer campaign or the exclamation mark in its title would indicate, the film can't quite decide its tone.",0
" This comedy raises the odd laugh, largely from an absurd appearance by Christopher Walken as a sinister martial-arts kingpin villain.",0
" Like a senior citizen with a nose-ring, 'In & Out' wears its hipness rather uncomfortably.",0
" Like many South Korean films, revenge is a major theme here, although the way Kim handles it is particularly subtle and surprising: It sneaks up on you. ",1
 Kruger is compelling in the central role in this pacy procedural thriller which is persuasive in its depiction of contemporary spycraft but less convincing in mounting a case for why she would work for Mossad in the first place.,1
" As sumptuous as it is immensely shallow, the film practically revels in its attention to lush English landscapes as a means to distract from its derivative storytelling. ",0
 a tasty cocktail of romance and jealousy,1
 Sometimes a meal can be less than perfect but still so thoroughly enjoyable that a missed ingredient here or a bit of overcooking there doesn't really matter.,1

 The Wedding Guesthas some thrilling aspects but the film falls just a bit short as a thriller.,0
" One of the most interesting movies ever made, but also, perhaps, one of the most anticlimactic.",1
 It's strangely pleasing to see so much spectacle and stunt work attached to something as stupid as a game of tiggy. ,1
" Portraying a cutthroat business in which little is ""fair,"" ""Don't Think Twice"" acknowledges the bloodshed, but applies the razor with enough empathetic delicacy to earn its cautiously upbeat fade.",1
" If I sat down and watched Dumb and Dumber for a fourth time, I would certainly laugh at it more often than I laughed at this amiable-but-unnecessary sequel.",0

 The first spectacular surprise of this holiday season.,1
 So much of what they have to say sounds banal or extraneous compared to the music heard on the soundtrack.,0

" Paul is E.T. and Fanboys mixed together with a lot of pot. It has a few laughs, but I expected more from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.",1
 Beyond The Hills has a rich understanding of the appeals and perils of religious values that provide structure and meaning to some while seeming cruel and irrational to outsiders.,1

 I wonder if it escaped from the 20th Century Fox lot as a tax write-off.,0
" Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness-one of his distinguishing characteristics. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a corrective to the tired, false ""dumb jock"" stereotype.",1
 The movie travels down a bumpy road full of plot holes and left-turn logic that will have many in the audience chuckling at the idiocy of the various characters and situations. (Movie Review for Parents also available),0

" To understand von Trier one must accept Gregory of Nazianzus's explanation of the ascetic doctrine as ""the pleasure of no pleasure.""",1
" ""The Nun,"" shot in murky pools of darkness that often leave you squinting at the screen, is a dispiriting reminder that franchising evil inevitably dissipates its impact.",0
" Best described as slipshod, annoying and quite simply, shockingly bad.",0
" This strident, idiotic sequel is more like torture than entertainment - the cinematic equivalent of someone scratching their nails across a blackboard for the best part of two hours.",0
 Hong examines the turmoil of human interaction - the pain of honesty as well as the frustration of inexpressiveness.,1
" Blunt is mesmerizing in a role that requires her to be still often and let close ups of her red, puffy eyes, her quivering lips, her ruddy skin tell her current level of sobriety and her mental state.",1
" This scrappy little film is informed with a lot of truth about not only the Viagara-ridden porn business, but obsessional human behavior.",1
" It is an inane romantic drama that only a very young, very naive bartender could love. How it got that way is difficult to understand.",0
" Part of ""21's"" problem as it ups its stakes is that it's about as dangerous and sexy as a $1-minimum keno game. But it's still a mildly tantalizing timewaster about wish fulfillment told with casual confidence before a dragging finale.",1
" If you don't know by now what you're getting into when you see a movie from the Saw series, you deserve to be offended.",1

" As the film builds to a credulity-testing climax, there is less schmaltz than you might expect from the screenwriter of Chocolat -- though the filmmakers seldom hesitate to milk the Crowley kids and other Pompe-afflicted children for tears.",0
 Its numerous narrative strands are neither revealingly pursued nor properly intertwined.,0
" Every generation needs its own rowdy high school comedy, and Millennials deserve one that treats the anxieties teens have been grappling with for millennia with the same urgency that Jerry Bruckheimer would bring to a high-stakes action movie.",1
" The film is jolted into hopes and dreams and more importantly, escaping a blah life. But you can just sense there is something else. After all, this film isn't called 'Frank and April Move to Paris.'",1

 An entrancing mood piece.,1
 You would be well advised to give a wide berth to this largely useless adaptation of a book by Shannon Hale.,0
 suitably imaginative visuals and a knack for hitting the high points of the plot without missing a beat. . . a fabulously wild ride,1
" Energetic and inspired (sans Fogler), the picture concludes on a high note, providing the intergalactic goods with spirit, only one critical miscasting away from true satisfaction.",1
" Problem is: the tame, third-act plot payoff just isn't worth the build-up and doesn't come as much of a surprise if you listen carefully to the dialogue.",0
" Le Quattro Volte is cinematic slow food. It takes its time, is meticulous in its presentation, carefully considers the experience it provides, and then serves up a satisfying and nourishing feast.",1

" The actors are compelling. And Director Edward Zwick inflects the material with his trademark mix of moral zeal and high adventure, as in previous epics like Glory, Legends of the Fall and Blood Diamond. ",1
 It relies heavily on wacky plot developments and routine gross-out gags like a guy excusing himself from his lad-love's bed on their big night so he can suffer sudden-onset diarrhea.,0

 An uneven childhood memoir whose moments of heart are undermined by overt plot contrivances and a mawkish sentimentality.,0
 The Diplomat works more as a personal project than as an investigative documentary.,0

 Nothing that Chris Pine has done to date prepared me for how good he is here.,1
 Tighter editing and a more conventional bit of story structure would have made it better.,0

 This is an amiable film that will provoke some chuckles.,1
 A revolutionary procedural.,1
" Bigger, Stronger, Faster* should be a documentary that Michael Moore watches so that he can learn how to tell both sides of an argument.",1
" Most filmmakers today don't take risks of this scale with original stories. Shyamalan didn't take the safe route, and in so doing, will polarize audiences.",1
" Leprechaun: Origins isn't just bad - it's downright insulting. Lipovski's film is nothing but a series of bad choices, worse execution and infuriating redundancy, highlighting the ugliness that comes along with exploiting horror instead of respecting it.",0
" Even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making, a liberation journey that just isn't the same old, same old when a director was born in South Africa.",1
 It seems to be Blake's name as much as anything that propels the character deep into a strange frontier where Blakean ideals of innocence and integrity have been obliterated by ignorance and cruelty. ,1
" The sheer audacity and originality of the exercise makes it a must-see, regardless of what you might think of the success or failure of any particular choice.",1
" While fans of the series may get something out of the sequel, there is nothing on display that could possibly sway naysayers.",0
 It's a fascinating angle on a multi-faceted individual.,1
" Mangold cleverly frames the story with Cash's historic 1968 concert in Folsom Prison, but he does little to illuminate its significance to the Man in Black.",0
" Easily the summer's feeblest blockbuster, this isn't even one the kids will enjoy, thanks to a dry-as-dust first half and a final hour that could be marketed as a cure for insomnia.",0
" I don't think I believed the movie Lucky You, but I sort of enjoyed it. A caveat: I enjoy watching poker on ESPN. If you don't, this movie will bore you.",1
" An above-average, obscenity-laden buddy comedy that mostly excels due to the brilliant comic pairing of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson.",1
 Rebecca Hall has the misfortune to be extremely good in a film that always feels somewhat exploitative and too miserable to be a rewarding watch.,0
" Marjane's outlook on events is always slightly skewed and caricatured, and the visuals keep Persepolis striking to the eye even during its less dramatically satisfying patches.",1
" Edward Zwick has made a fast-moving, well-crafted film that, like most melodramas, is far too predictable, but, unlike most melodramas, somehow doesn't completely embarrass itself.",1
" Inconsistency is the curse of the anthology film, but the entries in the omnibus New York, I Love You are united by their near-total lack of interest.",0
" As the film plods on, Woo's initial, slightly mysterious charm wilts from overexposure; the frantic antics fall flat and the whole contrived mess begins to feel increasingly obvious and boring.",0

 Haynes' fastidious cinematic diorama of New York emerges as a tedious and self-indulgent folly.,0
" As far as romantic comedies go, the hackneyed Over Her Dead Body falls more towards the bottom of the heap",0
 What Cianfrance can't do is find a definitive ending: the film has at least three as it builds to a high pitch and thus runs long. But along the way it's passionately gripping and much more than the cliche of a tear-jerking romance.,1
 Sometimes simple is better. The original thrived on few integral characters and a world-wise approach to storytelling. This feature seems to think action is more important than story and an overabundance of characters is a necessity.,0
 Looking for a good con? Put your faith in Confidence.,1
" Meretricious hooey...that turns the premise of an endlessly-repeating day into an inane, fatally humorless afterschool special.",0
" As silly as it is, there's a relentless energy bursting from every aspect of High School Musical 3.",1
 It's a credit to the actors that this nonsensical thriller/sci-fi story comes off as reasonably well as it does.,0
 Director and scenarist execute their tale with enough restraint - reflective of the lead character's stunted emotional range - to eke out poignancy from what's at core a somewhat predictable narrative arc.,1
" The film has been attractively packaged, and if -- like many fans -- you'd pay to watch Clint read a menu, then you'll find Space Cowboys an enjoyable time warp back to the summer of '98.",1
 So self-indulgent and all over the place that it never truly finds its feet. ,0
" If Gerard Butler exudes rakish charm and Jessica Biel a charming flintiness, then why is Playing for Keeps so utterly charmless?",0
 British dance flick is cliched but clean and fun.,1
" There is clearly some intentional satire here, but there's too much attention paid to the spectacle and not enough to what little substance there is.",0
 An action movie in the most profound and exalted sense of the term ...,1
" Despite a moving, canny incarnation of the man by Frank Langella, despite a slickly entertaining coffee-table production as only Ron Howard knows how, the movie feels cooked up. In the name of dramatizing history, Frost/Nixon sacrifices it.",0
" It starts and ends exceptionally well, but it gets bogged down in the middle. ",0
 Reverently reductive,0
" Corbet should leave this exhaustingly auspicious freshman effort with plenty of notes; one suspects, with some intrigue, that he'll return with far more for us.",0
" With its charming characters and nonstop jokes, this movie is worth crossing the road to see.",1
" Everything feels comfortably familiar, yet halfway through this plate of pleasing nostalgia and orchestrated pathos, you realize there's not much substance between the focaccia. We may love our two leads but their characters never feel entirely developed.",1
" Its view of life is so utterly out of touch with reality (why do we hardly ever see the maid doing any work, for example?) that it's ultimately more exasperating than rewarding.",0
" The look, achieved by John Wakayama Carey to reflect a simple beauty of the surroundings, is the finishing flourish of a film that delivers a punch nobody will see coming.",1
" Godzilla is back, and he still has something to teach us.",1
" Anyone who has traveled for work, especially across the country's heartland, will appreciate the view.",1
" The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon, extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away.",0
" Assumed identities, heartbroken children, complex love triangles and the realisation that inertia is hell in itself all feature in this thoughtful, soulful film.",1
 Can have a relatively sophisticated visual sense and yet in other respects seem like a teenager's first short story.,0
 Hoodwinked! is a collection of everything that's gone wrong with animation lately and nothing that's gone right.,0
" An over-stuffed, hyper-pulpy, and mostly trite trifurcated drama about family, crime, and moral ambiguity.",0
" [T]he rare sequel that improves on the original. Granted, that wasn't hard... but neither is saying this damning with faint praise. I laughed out loud more than once during this very silly yet often very clever flick.",1
" Eden's best quality is it's bittersweetness: a story about postponing adulthood and an honest portrait of fun, confusing and good times as a teen. [Full review in Spanish]",1
 Sinsiter and savvy psychodrama,1
" By the genre's most basic standards, [Seagal] now displays a visible fatigue and lack of interest that proves deadlier than any of his hero's skills.",0
" Even more than the remake that it is, Everybody's Fine plays like a homogenized, Hallmark Channel version of About Schmidt, with all the rough edges shaved off.",0
" But, there's also little doubt in my mind that ""Homicide"" is pure Mamet in its uncut form, and that's a pretty great thing.",1
" In Letters to Max, the cinema itself serves as a time machine: a vehicle for nostalgia, for reconstructing the past(s) and places lost, but also for accessing a time and place that have not yet arrived.",1
" Franco lays on mannered tics, like a slurred vocal delivery reminiscent of Benicio del Toro's mush-mouthed hood from The Usual Suspects.",0
" As Summer, Zooey Deschanel is an enchanting, blue-eyed mixture of nearness and distance. You can see why Tom loves her, even as she stomps on his heart. ",1
" Throughout the film, Pattinson's control of his accent, his ability to add complexity to an imbecilic character, and his comedic timing are new signs that he is more than that Twilight dream boy.",1
" The punchy, nonstop visual effects crowd out coherent storytelling.",0
" The Woman in Black has lovely period atmosphere. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much else besides atmosphere.",0
" Spielberg brings back the awe with ""The BFG,"" a fantasy designed to tickle the kid in each of us.",1
" White House Down should not be as enjoyable as it is. And yet, it finds a way. Pass the popcorn.",0
" The film seldom reaches the pitch of Goldfinger, but it does stay on tune, thanks to performers who know how to belt out an old favorite.",1
" The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.",0
" Bratz is a disappointment because the characters come off less as the girly superheroes they should be, and more as, well, brats.",0
" Religulous is the type of film to be sent off into the world to crack open a few eyes and change some lives. In reality, only those patient with Maher and already free of devotion will be receptive to the message. It's a missed opportunity.",0
 The Big Short functions as a real-life Kafka farce.,1
 Warmly revealing ...,1
" As abstract as the film is in theory, it is brought together with the conclusiveness of finishing a puzzle with no missing pieces.",1

 It's Independence Day without the aliens and a president partial to Air Jordans.,0
" Garcia, who plays the least glamorous role of his life, does the best job of thieving each scene he's in. ",1
" Once disbelief is suspended, it's quite a ride. As with Avatar last year, the reason to see Tron: Legacy is for the experience. Lights flash. Radiating discus hurl through the air in 3D. The music pounds. ",1
" While not to be confused with the 1987 Dudley Moore body-swap comedy, Hirokazu Kore-eda's latest drama also undertakes its own kind of identity experiment, one that organically grows into something altogether more poignant",1
 Bernstein in action is a study of what a teacher should be: kind but with a steely resolve. He analyzes the music and figures how to overcome its obstacles.,1
" Well, it was fun while it lasted kids. The ghost train shudders to a halt with Paranormal Activity 4, the first entry in the usually innovative series unable to produce any decent scares.",0
" [C]alculated for sweet, feel-good blandness. And not the rock 'n' roll kind of feel-good, either, unless you think the Jonas Brothers rock hard.",0
 The biggest problem with this movie is that Tina Fey didn't write it.,0
" Despite the intriguing set-up, formula proves as hard a habit for Ephron to kick as magic is for Isabel.",0
" If had been in junior high school when I saw this movie, I would have had two words for ""28 Weeks Later.""Ew, gross.",0
 Its characters are driven by their beliefs in the power of dreams and in otherworldly spirits that rule their lives. Their hubris leads them to take actions that inevitably have fatal consequences. It really is quite a beguiling tale.,1
" With its rich, layered storytelling, ""Film Socialisme"" is, in its broadest sense, about nothing less than the history, present and future of Western civilization, up to and including Internet videos of cats.",1
 Why take on a historical subject if you're just going to turn it into a biopic we've already seen? ,0
" In spite of its strong performances and glossy production, The Soloist plays a tune youve heard too many times.",0
 This startlingly silly venture runs out of gas long before it's over.,0
 Generally fine performances and isolated hilarious moments drift unanchored through a film that never gels into a solid form.,0
" Cook and Nightingale's kiddie flick is an uneasy, innocuous and easily avoidable anomaly.",0

 Good acting helps us overlook the story's obvious trajectory.,1
 The Die Hard of Die Hard knock-offs.,1

 Whatever charm existed in the original cartoons is trampled by this over-blown bore.,0
" It's a talking-animal movie based on a one-joke, not-very-funny comic strip. That should be sufficient information for anyone old enough to read this review.",0
" We begin to understand David's feelings of constant frustration at these dreary cycles of addiction, and while that might be exactly what the film (admirably) intends, there's no denying it makes for a vexing viewing experience.",0
 The 3D images are crisp and engrossing. Let the field trips begin!,1
" Zombies chase, heroes shoot, brains explode all over the wall. Rinse and repeat.",0
" It's determined to get dirtier, darker, grosser and more all-around ickier than any 'Vacation' before.",0
" There are images, however, in The Birth of a Nation that are so potent, disturbing, and visually precise that they will be seared into my memory for life. That's no small accomplishment.",1
 Not so much insidious as inexcusable.,0
" A pay-for-admission commercial for its own empire, it stretches the definition of a movie into something so ugly as to be unidentifiable",0
" Ryan Gosling's impassive visage must have the gravitational pull of a black hole, because Chazelle can't seem to keep his camera from being pulled loose from its moorings and drawn in thisclose for more than one or two scenes at a time.",0
" If you saw 21 Jump Street back in the '80s, or any of a number of shows featuring cute and cuddly cops, you pretty much know where this flick is heading.",0
" After 2002's terrible Swept Away and now Revolver, Ritchie has managed to make, back to back, two of the worst films any one director can lay claim to.",0
" Don't let anyone spoil the surprises of this thrashing, thrilling chunk of cinematic gold. It's one for the time capsule.",1
" De Bont remains an expert director of action, but putting the reference to cruise control in the title serves as fair warning of an unengaged filmmaker on automatic pilot.",0
 The lack of real wit in this became a bit tedious.,0
" Yet another screen version of the 1925 novel where style trumps substance, leaving us yearning for some characters who can engage our emotions.",0
" Zoe Saldana makes being an action hero look so easy in ""Colombiana,"" you have to wonder why more actresses don't try it.",1
" An emotionally potent, noticeably literary story of a precious boy's reaction to his father's death on 9/11.",1
" Wry self-sabotage after the fact is one of Merchant's secret weapons, and one of the reasons Fighting With My Family slips so nimbly under your defences.",1
" It sounds awful, but it's actually quite likable in an indulgent indie-spirited way, skipping breezily through laughter and tears in largely inoffensive fashion.",1
" Short on thrills with action sequences that for the most part feel perfunctory, the return of xXx is a bit of a let down; it might please the fans but could be so much better. ",0
 A brutally raw documentary about GIs manning an exposed outpost in the world's most dangerous place.,1
" Sadly, for a film at least partially about the impact of evening news and political coverage, little importance is given to the actual political content as compared to the results.",0
 Silliness is cinematic buoyancy for a movie as lazy as Battleship.,0
" In fact, the force fed pious platitudes coupled with Carrey's familiar rubber-faced shtick renders this pseudo-virtuous vehicle a one-way ticket to the pearly gates of mediocrity.",0
 Ridiculous is fine. Ridiculous while trying to be deep and dramatic just doesn't cut it with Vin Diesel at the forefront...and its way too long. ,0
" There are laughs aplenty, and, as a bonus, viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts, urine, feces, semen, or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies.",1
 Last Holiday is a thoroughly mediocre dramedy.,0
" Genuinely original: a silly, hilarious and oddly profound adaptation for adult-sized children.",1

 The feeling of patent unbelievability never leaves.,0
 Disney underestimates the intelligence and sophistication of young audiences.,0
" ""Buddha.mov"" is excellent as it is unusual, and a must see for all fans of mockumentaries and mocking in general, as much as for those enjoying intelligent irony. ",1
" For all its valiant attempts to pump some Matrix magic back into science-fiction films, the Wachowskis' ambitious interplanetary thriller Jupiter Ascending amounts to a lot of recycled hot gas.",0
" Alas, Andersen -- a longtime academic -- often says far too much, and in typically stultifying, grad- school language.",0
" A refreshing entry into the recent canon of Australian films, Bran Nue Dae recalls the innocent, playful tone of classics such as Muriel's Wedding and The Castle and, as such, deserves to be the summer smash of 2010.",1
" Childishly simplistic... it runs in circles willy-nilly, throwing in the occasional cheap shot while breathlessly telling us stuff we already knew.",0
" Somewhere, another eight-year-old girl is dreaming of being a filmmaker. Ocean's 8 won't be the kick of inspiration she needs, unless the message she takes away is: You can do better than this.",0
 This film's slightly uneven structure is easily overcome by the exceptional cast.,1
" There is the nagging feeling that much of the film's story, dialogue and character development were left on the cutting-room floor.",0
" Lightly amusing but doggone derivative, the film bombards the audience with jokes, action and effects to produce an overstuffed experience that rarely enchants. ",0
" It's just not at all satisfying, even if it does have its head in the right place and comes with a powerhouse of great jokes.",0
" It starts out as not so much a movie as a commercial for Carnival Cruise Lines -- which perhaps shouldn't be a surprising turn for a strictly cash-in threequel... And, anyway, can you bring rats on a cruise ship?",0
 A drab Southern drama about lives of quiet desperation and the people who lead them.,0
 A worthy finale to a fantastic franchise.,1
" The Wife starts off somewhat slowly, to the point where you wonder if anything is actually going to happen. Then, at the 50-minute mark, the ""twist"" of the story kicks in, and suddenly it becomes riveting.",1
" [Bieber is] the perfect first crush, and this is the perfect movie for someone currently experiencing that crush. ",1
" Unlike most Australian comedy films, which can barely sustain one viewing, Surfing Safari definitely holds up to a second helping, if for no other reason than to relish the period detail embedded into each frame, right down to the exploding pyjamas.",1
" It's Fonda's show, riffing on her Hanoi Jane past and aided by first-time screenwriters Christina Mengert and Joseph Muszynski's ear for how both smart people and New-Agers talk.",1
" It's actually refreshing that Lussier and Farmer don't belabor the film's internal mythology of satanic cults, hell and the devil's administrative assistants.",1
" Lara, at least, appears to know who she is. Now, if only her movies did her justice.",0
" James Franco shows less conviction than his muse, Tommy Wiseau.",0

" In its austere way, this is classic Wiseman, a film that takes us into the heart of a community and reveals its inner workings, comforts, fractures and traumas.",1
" Star Trek Into Darkness is a first class ticket into outer space. If you feel the urge, rocket yourself into blockbuster happiness.",1
 A dumb and cheesy period potboiler...Quoth this critic: It's a bore.,0
" [Hugh] Jackman has the singing-dancing-acting chops to warrant the title. His Barnum is a heightened choice, one perhaps more suited to the stage than screen, but what a relief to sit down to a musical with a Broadway-ready cast.",1
 ...the close-to-two-hour running time stretches this decidedly thin premise much further than it has any right to.,0
" It's rare to find a romance that's actually based on such vivid characters as these, but then this is from Oscar-winning filmmaker Susanne Bier (In a Better World), who knows how to root films in people rather than plot structure. ",1
" Rooting for the safety of the sweet girl, heroic trucker, and vulnerable mother will have you on the edge of your seat.",1
" If you loved the book, you probably will love this, but honestly? It's not that good.",0
 The limp narrative about a Tamil boy and a (Tamil?) Tiger is buoyed by glorious 3D-enhanced visuals and anchored by its meditations on religion and neo-colonialism.,1
" Crosses the finish line quite a few furlongs behind such classics of the girl-and-her horse genre as National Velvet, Black Stallion or Gypsy Colt.",0
" A great documentary, a great night out, and a great eye-opener. You'll never look at an ingredients list the same way again...",1
" Harrison has devised a series of mini-dramas which he inserts, in intercut fashion, within the overall structure of the rave, and it's here that his effort fizzles.",0
 One might even go so far as to say that this is an excellent example of style over substance.,1
" In the tradition of recent Hollywood sequels, this one replays the old gags, gooses up the pace and lowers the level of the humor -- way lower.",0
" Nicole Kidman could hardly be more enchanting in the lead, but the script is one of writer-director Nora Ephron's weakest, the laughs are scattered and we leave the movie feeling it sure could have been better.",0
" Director Sam Raimi's dull, kitschy and overlong patchwork is sadly an epic fail - despite the presence of Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis as a trio of witches.",0
" Carell plays it fairly straight in a movie that hits high on the scales of comedy and romance, with just a dollop of dramatic reality. It's almost as if he were playing, well, real life.",1
" Guy Ritchie trains his maniacally excessive eye on Camelot in this brawny, leaden action spectacle that's enlivened by the occasionally winning overabundance. But the story's mythic qualities have been stripped away in the name of crafting a blockbuster.",0
 Watching Twilight Saga: New Moon is a bit like having your own real-life sulky teenager living under your roof . . .,0

" That rare thing, a sequel of true merit. ",1
" All elements of the ancient catastrophe are rendered with the most up-to-the-minute CG technology. So the special effects are first rate. The story they serve, not so much.",0

 Controversial documentary best for older teens.,1
" The film is based on actual events in the life of British writer-personality Alan Bennett that he turned into a book in 1989, a play in 1999, and now a film directed by Nicholas Hytner. You might call this beating a dead horse. The English call it thrift.",1

 Martin Scorsese's love letter to filmmaking finally proves that 3D is a necessary aesthetic to storytelling if used correctly. I definitely shed a few nerd tears!,1

" Pacino's ex-partner laughs, ""Shouldn't you be fishing?"" Who says he isn't? Oh sure, Pacino is technically on the set...but he generally isn't any more present here than he'd be on the back of a boat somewhere watching a fishing lure bob up and down.",0
" ...Garner's performance effectively keeps things interesting, even when the film is going through the motions...",1
" Frankenweenie's biggest crime is that it's a comedy that isn't funny. There's no zip to the script, few jokes that stick in the mind.",0
" ""Puzzle"" steadfastly refuses to adhere to formula, instead going for something messier and more authentic.",1
" While zine-style animated sequences and VHS taped interviews enliven the pace, the documentary is burdened by too much minutiae. Not every scar earned at a concert deserves to be immortalized in a documentary.",0

" Habemus Papam gets lost in the secular wilderness, as the incognito Pontiff wanders about Rome, mixing with the common flock, in an overly pat commentary on the burden of infallibility.",0

 Disarming sincerity and an old-fashioned sense of class.,1

" Underdeveloped and tedious, ""Art School Confidential"" left me irritated and annoyed.",0
" We likely have a sequel because the first Steve Martin family comedy successfully grossed 3 1/2 times its budget by teasing light humor out of family high jinks. That's all fine, but did it have to be set in summer camp-style?",0

 This dim movie invites suicidal comparison with Altman's ensemble pieces.,0

" When not saddled by the awkward narrative, Keaton and Douglas reveal a pleasing chemistry, though neither are doing anything new: Douglas growls while Keaton smiles, cries and sings.",0
" Surprisingly rich entertainment, even takes on well known series: Star Wars, LOTR, & Die Hard; framed squarely within a sub-par opening and weak ending. Still, I liked it!",1
" The new Miami Vice movie is not designed to leave audiences in a partying mood. On its own terms, though, it's frequently worthy of cheers.",1
 The problem here is that the film-makers throw too many elements into the mix. Grand Guignol bloodletting is combined with characters and ideas which often seem to have been borrowed from Rebecca.,0

 It's a weak-tea imitation at best.,0
 It's the kind of film which has great stills but never quite comes alive when it actually moves -- likely to win at the box-office quicker than it does in the mind.,0
 Humongously enjoyable and gloriously predictable.,1
" A scavenger hunt conceived in liberty and dedicated to the notion that all Jerry Bruckheimer films are created equal (equally dumb, that is).",0
" There's still something undeniably moving about the film's trajectory, which allows McConaughey to blossom into an empathetic figure-one whose homophobia fades as his fighting spirit intensifies-without losing his rapscallion spirit. ",1
" It is original, and these days that always counts for something. ",1
" Invincible sucks the soul out of the real-life events and offers a generic, glossy revision of the story.",0

 mimics the original without quite catching what made that original worth seeing,0
" Mean Spider-Man wrecks city streets for no reason, makes sarcastic remarks, interpretive dances and is actually pretty funny. You'd want to hang out with Mean Spider-Man and talk over beers about what a tool Nice Spider-Man is.",0

" The inventiveness of the death scenes isn't quite enough to compensate for the dullness of the rest, but it comes close.",0
" The American is a spare, tightly-wound thriller that is less the story of a man who kills for a living, than what that life has extracted from his soul.",1
 The film subtly links the complex bureaucracy required to pursue stability between nations with the fostering of certain conditions that allow resentful egotists with dangerous ideas to flourish if we let them.,1
" On the page the narrator's tone is clearer than it is on-screen, where images dominate dialogue.",0
 Those who have seen enough of these films - and who know all their tricks - will likely recognize that Hitch is nothing special.,0

" Like so many filmmaking wunderkinds who could have used a course in common sense, Glanz is technically assured but emotionally hollow.",0
" Minute for minute, it is one of the most tense and exciting war movies ever made.",1
" Thanks to the wonder of digital technology, Marlon's head was spliced onto the body of a dwarf actor, thus accomplishing what certainly will go down in history as one of the more profound cinematic achievements of our time.",0
" Juno's dialogue was artificial but sounded good; it was musical. This dialogue sounds like writing, like gears turning.",0
" The loopy performances, character quirks and throwback visual gimmicks help to disguise the more formulaic genre elements in the script, although the film never finds an emotional entry point amid its onslaught of bloody nihilism.",0
" A little The Replacement Killers, a little TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze and a little Mortal Kombat. Make of that what you will.",0

" As writers, the Nelms brothers have crafted a comedic crime narrative most akin to the Coen Brothers or Shane Black.",1
 A surprisingly funny and astute satire of the two-party political system.,1
" This balance between punches and plot derails in the second half. As the body count mounts, the film's hold loosens. As does the logic keeping the narrative together. When all is revealed, too many questions remain.",0
 You just can't help thinking that slightly more tempered ambition would have resulted in a more successful result.,0
" There's a comfort to be found in Hart's skyrocketing mobility that makes America clap and cheer and howl along. It hardly matters that his jokes aren't that funny, or that he runs hack-y catchphrases into the ground for cheap laughs.",0

" At its best, Adam makes the viewer understand the frustration of living in a world in which everyone is a stranger.",1
" The truth is that this film is mostly plain work, done by rote, like any introductory potions class. The real fun -- and thrills and tears -- come next year.",0
 You can't tell yourself it's just a movie.,1
" The movie never envelops us or the characters in palpable paranoia or edge-of-your-seat suspense. A series of well-timed, PG-13-rated shocks compensates.",0
" Ho-hum in its action scenes, void of tension, and miscast from top to bottom, The Meg is as dead-in-the-water a shark movie as there has ever been.",0
" It tells a valuable story in a way that mostly recalls other, more vital versions of stories from the same endlessly dramatized historical period.",0
" Production Stands Tall, Story Washed Out",0
 A picture that clicks on all cylinders.,1
" The distance between the characters and real life allows us to wander without fear, but the seduction of the story pushes us to do so with greater passion. [Full review in Spanishi]",1
" It's overlong, overcrowded and over here. But it gives everyone a go on the tricycle and propels each to dramatic (if not exactly fresh) catastrophes.",1
 The filmmakers' decision to focus less on goofy shenanigans and more on the political costs of a Godzilla attack in 2016 is both surprise and a revelation.,1
" Provides further evidence, not that any was necessary, of the legendary performer's magnetism and musical virtuosity.",1
" Excruciating dialogue is only the tip of the iceberg of this film's dunderheadedness, but it's the sin that keeps on giving throughout the way too many 108 painful minutes it takes to get through it.",0
 An exercise in commercial cowardice masquerading as a thriller about political bravery.,0
" L.A. Burning doesn't feel vital in its retelling, but gets intriguing once it moves past the riots to focus on a question hanging over the story of 1992: How does a black man reconcile these truths and survive, in this world?",1
" For all its teary, heartfelt melodrama and bloodily chaotic machine gun fury there is very little here to hold on to, and while sitting through all 137-minutes is hardly a chore it's not like doing so has done me any favors.",0
" ...a quirky little film with some humorous little touches, but what its author is trying to say is murky and its protagonist engenders no sympathy, in fact the opposite. The cult of July can continue without me.",0

 A totally cringe-inducing movie. Stay away from it unless you enjoy gawking at severely damaged personalities.,0
 A homegrown and unassumingly grotesque head-scratcher ...,1
 Aardman Animations gives viewers what we didn't know we needed: a football origin story. Early Man is eccentrically funny and mostly warm-hearted.,1

" It's hard to tell whether Ridley Scott's Exodus is a misfire satire or a creative misfire, but I suspect it's the latter given that it takes itself so seriously",0
" Sullenberger's heroics made for a great news story, now, in the capable hands of director and star, they are the foundations for a riveting, cinematic drama.",1
" While the film showcases moments of enormous power, there is something missing; perhaps it's subtlety, or perhaps it's the emotional connection the movie so desperately wants to make, but in the end, can't quite achieve.",0
" The ""story"" of the movie is barely there, but the feelings it evokes are as haunting as its parade of lost spirits. ",1
 Even die-hard fans will cover their ears in protest.,0
" Brutal and redundant but not without a certain ugly integrity, this gruesome sequel allows Zombie to continue to explore his idea that Michael Myers is a pathetic and tragically irredeemable product of childhood abuse...",0

" Very stylistic, exciting and entertaining, Tim Burton weaves an entirely new spin on the Washington Irving classic.",1
" Like most movies based on old television shows, Dukes is all concept, with a few jokes written into its crevices.",0
 For a film this wacky to work it has to establish rules in its universe and stick to them which the two directors accomplish masterfully.,1
 Stylish horror pic that is done in by its illogical and crude fantasy narrative.,0
" In fact, it is the best possible ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" movie you could hope to see, but then that's a bit of a loaded compliment isn't it? This is about as well-trod as creative territory gets.",1
" Like the first movie, the sequel squanders its promising satirical premise ... for gags that really have nothing to do with the situation or even the characters.",0
" The subtle but striking documentary follows the family for nearly a decade; we watch as spectators to the Raineys' everyday life as they deal with illness, tragedies, surprises and the joys of life.",1
" a tease, a total sham",0
 Planted smack-dab in the middle of the January dumping season -- where cinematic stinkers are unleashed to dirty the elbows of Oscar hopefuls -- Broken City is slotted exactly where it belongs.,0

" Like a Twilight Zone episode of old, Radius opens with an arresting premise and then withholds some vital information, keeping you guessing right through to its shocking conclusion.",1
" It is remarkable how, with all of the advances in technology over the years, a story like this can remain largely unchanged despite a 35 year gap between tellings. By allowing the movie to unfold in real time, Scott enhances the level of suspense.",1
 Fiennes seems intent on showing us the shackles of Victorian morality but his characters barely rattle the chains.,0
 This unexpectedly charming animation bursts out of the screen with an aesthetic that is a sugar rush of cuteness.,1

" What Pixar's latest 'toon lacks in plot freshness, it makes up for with great characters, fun vocal performances, and a script with genuine emotional heft.",1
" Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass have created a fiery, quick-witted film that presents compelling evidence that the action-suspense genre has been ""Bourne again.""",1
 Frantically and refreshingly fun.,1
" Let's just say any film that has a high school romance rekindled, hints of incest, cancer, professional baseball, mental disability and repeated vomiting has too much going on, especially when some things have no tie to the basic story.",0
 Mansfield Park...is a confusing jumble of historical drama and modern social essay that only serves to cloud the whole field of Jane Austen studies.,0
" The mandate here is to guarantee a splendid time for all, and it's achieved admirably, given that we already know the story a thousand times over.",1
" Not to be a killjoy, but if filmmakers are going to embed pixel mayhem in the photo-real world, then they're inviting us to ask if this shit is sociopathic. ",0
" It's time to break out the thesaurus to find enough accolade adjectives to describe this comedy, which has an adult competing in a spelling bee for elementary school students.",1
" Let's put it thus: Even if we were to ignore the acting skills (or the complete lack of it) of everybody who claims to be an actor in this film, there is just no way you could live peacefully with the cliched, irritating dialogues in the film.",0
" Project Almanac has enough heart and brains to keep it steady even as the camera isn't, and its wires-and-widgets variation on ""The Monkey's Paw"" is very much informed and improved by the charm and capabilities of its young cast.",1
" Turns history into the equivalent of a horror movie, one with a less-than-stellar cast and some serious plot holes.",0
 [Director Ari Aster] wisely avoids resorting to cheap scares and incorporates the right amount of exposition without preying upon it and frightening the public just for pleasure. [Full review in Spanish],1
" It seems less that Crowe's gifts have escaped him than that they've become disproportionate with his excesses, and we're less forgiving of those trespasses.",1
" A key moment... has all the poignancy of discovering an old toy in the attic-or in this case, in the middle of a desert-and finding not only that it still works, but it has a role in saving the universe.",1
" Derivative, predictable and dull despite much hectic action, it ends with the foreshadowing of a sequel you know will never come, the very definition of a hoped-for series that arrives pre-embalmed.",0
 Edwards is a wizard with his laptop's effects program. The squiddy things he conjures up look like the real deal - thoroughly creepy and a gazillion feet tall. ,1
" As a romantic weepie, not bad. As a drama about a disabled man, possibly offensive.",0
 A ridiculous teenybopper-geared retooling of the fairy tale.,0
" More likely, most audiences will come away having had the good time that comes from a piece that is erudite, truthful and dark -- and funny because of all of these things.",1
" With its conspicuous display of prefascist trappings, it says more about our time than about Rome.",0
 A difficult self-indulgent satire to enjoy.,0
" Biopics are too often lifeless affairs, weighed down by historical plot points and never really finding their own narrative groove. Not so for Martin Provost's enthralling Violette.",1
" La La Land has us with our eyes glued, feet tapping and hearts pounding with anticipation of just what wonder it's going to produce next.",1
 The film almost completely falls apart in the second half when it becomes as loud as it is tedious.,0
" Ismael's Ghosts is a film defined by its excesses, and the most frustrating thing about it is that the leaner, better film is staring you in the face the entire time.",0
" Having tamed one muscled man-child (Vin Diesel in The Pacifier), Disney sets its sights on The Rock.",0
" Gives Del Toro the chance to shine, but it just uses his portrait of a modern-day monster as a backdrop to a pulp B-movie plot that Hutcherson isn't equipped to carry.",0
" The action sometimes conjures a thrill-ride's breathtaking quality or, in other words, Terminator Salvation's only hope of redemption with audiences.",0
" In a place where it doesn't seem like there isn't much to be excited about at first, Lambert proves otherwise by showing how the secrets we keep can make us just as unknown to one another as the aliens from above.",1
" The new Vacation isn't a trip worth taking. If you thought I could have ended this review with any other sentence, I'm not sure what you were reading.",0
" ""Chernobyl Diaries"" is just senseless, idiotic, and pointless. If a horror movie is going to be chock full of people making stupid decisions, it would be nice if they were at least somewhat logical.",0
 Finally: Ghost without the thrills or laughs! That describes the utterly toothless Just Like Heaven.,0
" This increasingly ramshackle thriller somehow manages to bodge many of its key plot points, leaving the narrative as badly maintained as the rundown houses it occupies.",0
" She's not corporeal, so she compensates by being totally irritating, which gradually causes him...to fall in love with her?",0
" ""Escapes"" is as unconventional as its subject, demonstrating the charming things that can happen when a life in no way ordinary gets documented by a filmmaker most unusual.",1
" Like a good car the series needs all of its parts to work. And also like a car, if you keep adding more parts, it only works better. (I know nothing about cars.)",1
" There's an abundance of toilet humour, masturbation, oral sex and fantasies about threesomes with an oversized bag of weed ... The target market will no doubt be primed",0
 Anderson never once lets on that he's making a message movie; it's mesmerizing to watch.,1
 By far the most original comedy of the year.,1
 Seeing this movie is like watching two straight men performing an act: Neither one has any jokes.,0
 surprisingly successful,1
 So ludicrous that it might not even convince a sugar-addled 10-year-old on a Saturday morning.,0
 Amanda Seyfried is terrific as the most famous porn star of all time. The quality of the acting is impressive. Seyfried and Sharon Stone as her mother should be considered for year end awards.,1
" A culture-clash comedy that, in addition to being very funny, captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe.",1
" Offbeat buddy comedy has language, drinking, some drugs.",1
" West, making his first foray into westerns, doesn't control the tone. Its somber, bone-dry gruffness crumbles to dust, only to be replaced by adolescent jokiness.",0
" This could have been a City Slickers on cycles. But it's an incredibly lazy movie, from the on-the-nose casting to the soundtrack ('70s vintage road rock) to the script to the scouting of locations.",0
" Suspiria is not a movie that will gel with everyone. It will awaken the sickest, most twisted parts of your mind if you allow it.",1
" Saw V utterly mimics the original film's formula -- that awful basement, those cops chasing clues in what we assume to be the same time-frame, those awful devices of death.",0
" Damon is an agile comic performer, and Soderbergh knows how to serve him up without losing sight of the ultimate seriousness behind it all.",1
 Just how bloody far are we supposed to suspend our disbelief for a slice-and-dice horror flick?,0
" There are a number of cheeky winks from the filmmakers specifically aimed at Harryhausen fans; in the end, though, Leterrier's Clash of the Titans is nearly as messy an assemblage of mythic odds and ends as the original.",0
" Feeling like it was ripped off the stage, the film features performances that range from natural to ludicrous and developments that, save for the satisfying final twist, become increasingly absurd. But the end doesn't quite justify the means.",0
 The comedy surprise so far of the year.,1
 All dressed up with no place to go.,0
 [P]acks as many thrills and as much fun into thirty minutes as any of the Indiana Jones films did into their entire running times.,1
 This indie drama is unconvincing as a love story and heavy-handed in its message of tolerance.,0
" Presented with such confidence, such care, that we love all of the characters, even if we don't like them.",1
 Hedges' story brings it all together in a story that is urgent and unexpectedly suspenseful right down to the final frame.,1
 So bland and punchless that it may prompt more yawns than grins from audiences.,0
" They've devised a potentially rich premise, only to play it safe, smoothing off every sharp edge and dumbing down any acerbic point.",0
" Tony Cox as a hilarious, pint-sized guttermouth is the main attraction of this movie, which is somewhat more depressing than the trailers would have you believe.",1
 Glamorously louche.,0
 Rather pat and schematic.,0
" If you ignore its flaws, I am Legend can be enjoyed as the perfect brainless Boxing Day blockbuster - but it is essentially a leftover festive turkey.",0
 If you're after something decidedly unusual The Book Of Life is well worth checking out.,1
" If you're a fan of Sparks, and like-minded feel-good romantic dramas, Safe Haven will deliver what you know and love; everyone else should be well warned by now.",0
" Suleiman's obvious gift for cinema makes you wish that in connecting so personally with his past, he'd occasionally reach out to the audience, too.",0
" A well-cast, witty bore.",0
" It's essentially constructed from crime-film cliches, that could claim a pension and, worst of all, it's way too long.",0
" Depp easily steals the show, delivering a quirky performance that has him teetering around like a flamboyant dandy with cerebral palsy...",1
" Nothing more than a zombie movie, but it's a first-class zombie movie, good, ghoulish fun, staged with skill and a nicely twisted sense of humor.",1
" This is Ferrell's movie, meaning some inspired laughs sandwiched between annoying bits that stretch on well past their usefulness.",1
" The good-ol'-boy humor mostly is dated and redundant, the low-tech car stunts are unlikely to thrill today's jaded audiences and the plot -- the Dukes saving the county from being turned into an open-pit mine -- is a yawner.",0
" With its edges sandpapered smooth, the story about an affable loser discovering he has fathered 533 children is rendered ludicrously feel-good and nonsensical.",0
" It's a pic that's akin to a terrarium of plastic flowers -- gaudily decorative, but airless and lifeless.",0
 This is cinema most fine.,1
" This send-up of current horror movies is a go-for-broke hoot, a hot mess of a comedy that doesn't have a lick of sense. And knowing that going in adds to the often knee-slapping laughs.",1
" A cynical, chill-inducing, blood-splattering cinematic operetta! Forget about your preconceptions - and relish one of the 10 Best Movies of 2007.",1
 Every frame wows with exquisite arrangements of light and color; each of the characters' choices is packed with a sense of consequence and urgency that makes us feel as if we're frittering away our lives by comparison.,1
" A sobering examination of corruption, courage, cowardice, and the sometimes catastrophic costs of telling the truth.",1
" A ball of gender confusion, Biblical allegories and Eastern European politics -one of those would be a tricky subtext for a 90-minute rock opera. But the songs marry Jim Steinman's grandeur to the Stooges' sweat and spit, with a deft, tender screenplay.",1
 What a perverse niche Paul Greengrass has carved out for himself.,0
 Combines the worst elements of two Ben Affleck films - Jersey Girl and Surviving Christmas - for an indigestible stew of gross-out slapstick and holiday humiliation.,0
 One decision Gangs of New York can never quite make is whether its primary disposition is toward punctilious social history or operatic amplifications of reality.,0
" If you're entering the theatre simply desiring a couple solid musical numbers, then your $15 will not have been spent in vain. Unfortunately, outside of its music, the movie falls flat as only a two-dimensional vignette of common misogyny can.",0
 Mick Taylor should be in the pantheon of classic horror characters along with Leatherface and Freddy Krueger.,1
" An instant contender for cult status on the midnight-movie circuit, where lines like 'Do we look like quantum wormhole specialists?' will be given the respect they deserve.",0
" As crazy as it may seem, it's a pretty compelling journey to watch.",1
" I can sit here and tell you the million and one ways Sharknado 2: The Second One is a pitiful failure, but that doesn't really matter since we'll be in the same situation next year discussing yet another Sharknado.",0
" We never see a single moment of strife within the Cavendish home, the family and their circle's upper lips so stiff they could serve tea on them.",0
 This is easily the worst movie set on Mars -- or anywhere in a Milky Way.,0
 ...truly one of the richest movie experiences this year.,1
 It all adds up to not just a document of the time but a blueprint for today's activists.,1
" Thematically tone deaf, stylistically inert and largely boring, I Love You, Daddy would be an awful film regardless of the news currently surrounding the writer/director.",0

 The movie's few ideas circle around each other without going anywhere.,0
" There are problems with Mrs. Hyde that have nothing whatsoever to do with Bozon's puzzling creative choices, though for perspective's sake, the problems are dwarfed by the choices. ",0
 The drama occurs only fleetingly and Greta Gerwig's cameo as one of Paul's flames is stilted.,0

" If you want to work your way into fresh independent flicks, Thoroughbreds is sure to shake your stable.",1
" Though the acting always teeters on the brink of terrible and you'd think twice about lining a budgie cage with pages from the screenplay, there is something tremendously entertaining about the experience that never quite wears off.",1
" What isn't straightforward about the plot is either hackneyed, implausible, or both.",0
" The real star here is Anderson, who glues together long, sweeping takes with quick edits and unique camera angles to create a visual masterpiece.",1
 Joe Wright creates feelings of pure joy and wonder in the audience as he takes our hand and flies us over the surreal landscape of a world that does not exist.,1
" ...a light, deliciously black, and consistently funny experience. ""Game Night"" is one of 2018's greatest surprises so far. [Full review in Spanish]",1
" We see the big picture way before the characters do, and that pushes us right out of the movie and back into our seats -- the last place we want to be.",0
" It's not as dynamic as the bond between siblings, but it does offer a gothic-fantasy love element that will keep tween girls engaged.",1
" ...the first time feature filmmakers, quite professionally, crossed the continent and collected a myriad of interviews and anecdotes about love.",1
 It's to the film's great credit that silly elements never get in the way of the film's grand passion,0
" There's no question that the film is full of gentle, good-natured mockery of the sort of knucklehead culture that we call ""redneck"" but it's all very sympathetic -- more so, even, than a Jeff Foxworthy You May Be a Redneck If (filll in the blank) routine.",1
" The movie has no supportive theme or rhythm, nothing to bind its dotty patches together.",0
" Byrne...owns her performance in Juliet, Naked.",1
" But the multi-talented Welles himself is awe-inspiring as the gruff and overweight Quinlan, a morally bereft man who realizes that his time is finally up.",1
 Good cast plus weak script equals so-so movie.,0

 ...quickly devolves into ludicrous plotting and cheap shock effects.,0
 A wrenching rush of adrenaline set in a never-ending cycle of occupation and struggle and ever-increasing tension.,1

" 'Cellular' moves so quickly and efficiently, you'll wish accessing your voicemail were as easy.",1

 Revolutionary Road hits theaters at the height of Oscar season. That doesn't mean it's Oscar worthy.,0
" Has problems in pacing, storytelling and character definition.",0
" The movie isn't terrible, so it can't qualify as a hate-watch. It's just dull.",0
" Having seen Bresson's filmography in full (including this film twice), I'm convinced that Lancelot of the Lake is on par with his very best and most transcendent work.",1
" It's the sound and image of democracy in high gear, and at times like our own, the documentary serves as a reminder that pushing back, and speaking out, isn't a luxury; it's a necessity.",1
" Fine as a mild diversion, but up against Pixar's high standards, it's a definite disappointment.",0
 It's the end of the world and it looks just fine.,1

" The World has a pokey pace, but it presents a uniquely powerful look at the new big kid in the global economy.",0
 Think Dead Poets Society... without the grandstanding.,1
" Spielberg goes a long, long way toward overcoming his tendencies toward the shallow, but the visceral punch of his not-quite-masterful film is softened by an almost neurotic slickness that keeps getting in the way of the [issues it raises].",1
 It's the cinematic equivalent of switching between 40 open tabs on your computer for two hours.,0
" Midway through ""It Comes at Night"" you might wonder where it's headed, and it seems Shults may have asked himself the same question. It's a breathless thriller that will leave you gasping until it finally runs out of air itself.",0
" Strictly judged by the yardstick of sex films, it's actually pretty conventional in its configurations of bodies and positions, and nothing one couldn't see with a couple of clicks on the Internet.",0
" Trust Kramer, though, to spring surprises with the help of a risk-taking cast.",1
" a horror anthology which chillingly showcases both the breadth of interesting ideas still available to explore within the genre, and the considerable talent of some of its most promising filmmakers.",1
" ...so stuffed with stunts, so bare on plot, you might as well call it Crouching Tiger, Hidden Story.",0
" Miley is charming, but every element of this concotion is calculated for commercial reasons, which would have been no problem if the picture was less formulaic and more engaging or entertaining.",0
" Everything in ""13th"" illuminates what is convincingly presented as a sad and tragic story that we are still living today.",1
 Encourages us to see the excitement and valor in little things.,1
 This film couple's vanity productions may keep them working but their fine talents are best realized under the direction of far better storytellers.,0
" All a goof. Revealing the pragmatic side of the CG-assisted filmmaker, [director] Gens makes a movie that seems entirely computer generated.",0

 The film is shot almost entirely in a haze of diffused light and a blue palette interrupted only by the red lipstick worn by Sofia. This is a film to be felt rather than watched.,0

 Depp is undeniably striking as the film's human centrepiece but his performance feels gimmicky; it's impossible to get past the freak factor. ,0

 Alcoholism. Grief. Loss. Not the first subjects you think of when you're watching an animated children's film. But Claude Barras' My Life as a Zucchini incorporates all three with an enormous amount of tenderness.,1
" A poorly written collection of comic-book movie cliches that offers nothing new to the genre, generates very little in the way of action thrills and plays like a self-important, humorless rip-off of Kill Bill.",0

" Even in the earthiest moments of the film, there's a sense of magic that reflects the filter of Hallam's innocence, eccentricity and otherness.",1
 Murphy's understated portrayal is a highlight in an otherwise heavy-handed examination of the way in which troubled souls come together to form surrogate families.,0
" You pay for the inventive frontloading, however. Most of the rest of the movie stretches out like the Gobi Desert, one hell of a plod between oases.",0
" Better to view it as a fiction, a what-might-have-been study in hubris and vision and human failings. In those terms, it's quietly fascinating, and only one of those two words really fits Steve Jobs.",1

 The meat of this franchise seems more in line with Edward Bernays than any fantasy or sci-fi author. This latest edition takes public relations to its bloodiest extreme.,1
" 'The Death Cure' is a fairly serviceable finale. Assuming, of course, that it's really the end. And if it is, then ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" left as it came: promising at first, but then the victim of repetition and overfamiliarity.",0

" I don't know anyone who'd want to watch, in these miserable times, a marriage swirling down life's khazi. But that doesn't stop it being a fine piece of work. And while I didn't enjoy it at all, I can definitely recommend it.",1
 The first Clash Of The Titans had considerably more charm than this. Money can buy you technology but it can't buy you magic.,0
" This is the crucible in which modern America was formed, the film seems to be saying: that it frequently resembles an apocalypse is its own tragic indictment.",1
" On the Beach at Night Alone noodles along quirky slight and rather charming until its midsection when, during a raucously funny, very drunk and true dinner party among friends, it springs to vivid, hilarious life and truly builds from there into something",1
" Some of the basic pleasures of the original remain intact (nobody shoots up a small room of bearded Eastern European men like Neeson), but ultimately the film feels compromised.",0
" The animation is crisply detailed, the voice work is solid, and the handful of musical numbers are memorably evocative of some of the fine work that Disney has done in that regard in the past.",1

 Stick It may be tough to stick out unless you're a girl between the ages of 11 and 16.,0
" It's predominantly a court procedural and a very redundant one, since all we're doing is re-capping what happened in the first two films and waiting two and a half hours for the verdict.",0
 A few people in the audience were laughing during the first half of the film. No one was laughing during the long walk out of the theater.,1
" For the most part it tries too hard, lurching from one plot contrivance to another and never giving any of its cast (apart from the heroically hard-working Marsden) much to do.",0
" It's self-indulgent, way too long and never as clever or funny as it's intended to be.",0
" What Spider-Man: Homecoming lacks in depth, it more than makes up for with a pop sensibility that fizzes with verve and fun. ",1

" As a babe-delivery system, The Spirit is a rousing success. In every other sense, it's a pronounced failure.",0
" While Anne Hathaway avoided food in preparing for this film, she compensated for her dietary restriction by chewing the scenery with uncontrolled gusto.",0
 The result is less of a movie than a sketch -- but a perceptive one,1
 It's an action movie in disguise. Jeremy Renner gets to bust out all the Hawkeye moves that he didn't get to use in Infinity War. ,1
" Movies simply do not get more ham-handed and hackneyed than this. Somewhere, Edgar Allan Poe is spinning in his grave. And somewhere, the folks who dole out Razzies are taking note.",0

 A harsh but gripping study in uncontrolled male aggression.,1

 Barber's overabundance of language and logos - her insistence on the artificiality and constructedness of the Scientist's natural environs - positions the jungle as a space of subconscious play rather than a lost paradise.,1

" Though at two hours, 50 minutes it feels overstuffed, the first ""Hobbit"" film holds its own thanks to inspired acting and some jaw-dropping technical innovations.",1
 A rare film when the random elements of filmmaking align in a formula equaling near-greatness.,1
 A comedy that doesn't go for cheap laughs is commendable. A comedy that doesn't go for any laughs at all is inexplicable.,0
" Hopes were so high. It's not that they were dashed and smashed, it's just that they wilted like a marigold in the sun.",0
" Every swing of its plot is preposterous, it stumbles to a trick climax that any regular moviegoer will figure out in the first 10 minutes, and the ending is so absurdly unmotivated that it plays like a slap in the face.",0
 An intellectual exercise lacking in tension.,0
" R.J. Cutler's vibrant and mischievous documentary The September Issue is only partly a movie about fashion. At its heart, it's really a movie about work, about the ways individuals compete with, grate against and inspire one another in the workplace.",1
" I found myself liking this as much or more than A Quiet Place, mainly due to the cast.",1
 It's quite refreshing to see a horror movie with high-quality performances like Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell deliver here.,1
" The whole thing feels like an afterthought, something to rustle up a little suspense and maybe fool some young people into thinking the movie's more like Armageddon than Ride the High Country.",0
" Wild Grass is nearly the same movie as Amelie, only minus the charm and the appeal.",0
" If you want songs about being happy, Pharrell is your guy. If you want to tell a story about a fellow as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel, you need a little less sunshine and a lot more stink, stank, stunk.",0
 Depp's performance...makes this journey into the world of a vicious crime lord endlessly engrossing and at times positively startling.,1

" Some of the worst acting, action and dialogue you'll endure this year.",0
" The film may have its occasional narrative flaws, yet ultimately emerges as a fulfilling feel-good story with the happiest of vibes.",1
" From the stiff performances to the odd narrative structure to the clunky editing to Allen's almost unbearable voice-over, this film fails.",0
 It's an exceptional Australian film that will lurk in the shadows of your memory for a long time afterwards.,1
 Rushmore is often touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious.,1
" Packs a ton of style and solid laughs, but in the end, it's mostly a hollow experience...",0
" Don't let its length make you avoid 'Toni Erdmann' (as it did me -- on two occasions -- at the 41st Toronto International Film Festival). It might be 2016's best film, with two all-time classic scenes included among its many marvels. ",1
" Stiller's performance is funny and substantive, a subtle portrait of middle-age, middle-class, white-guy anxiety existing somewhere between his best commercial comedy roles and prickly indies.",1
" Death Note carries a weirdly perfunctory air about itself throughout, even as the bodies begin to fall closer and closer to its main duo.",0
 The film contains a vast wealth of laughs that emanate from a kind of action-comedy slapstick I sincerely didn't know Tom Hardy had in him.,1
" Awesome creatures, breathtaking scenery, and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle.'",1
" You have to grant the Coens their due as creators of suspense, mood and plotting, and for their ability to color the most monstrous crimes with an undeniably funny sense of the absurd.",1
" Director Paul Greengrass creates a compelling film that is engaging without being preachy or didactic. Tom Hanks is, as always, stellar; and first-time actor Barkhad Abdi is moving as the villain/victim of the story.",1

 I had a hell of a good time at this movie.,1
" I Love You, Man is basically just an excuse to get Rudd and Segel together to share the spotlight for 105 minutes while exchanging banter and giving a glimpse into how some men really think. For me, that alone is worth the price of admission.",1
" The movie works pretty well for its first half, then turns so derivative that discerning audience members may find themselves passing the time playing Name That Rip-Off. I counted Alien, Aliens, The Hidden, Splash and a touch of Ben.",0
" Lowery's film haunts with its highly localised perspective on human history, as it goes/stays on a quest for a scrap of deferred meaning.",1
" Has a perfunctory, by-the-numbers approach to its story and its characters.",0
 It's definitely working that Babadook territory... Its final images are quite haunting.,1
 Moral: Parachute pants and Wang Chung are not enough.,0
" Law and order overbalance liberty in a police, adjective, state",1
" Bay seemingly can't help but make a movie that is loud, brash, nuance-free and more glandular than cerebral. ""13 Hours"" is a movie that stimulates the production of adrenaline, not insight.",1
" A handsome thriller, absorbing for its duration and with a couple of neat rug-pulls.",1
" Greetings From Tim Buckley is a beautiful, touching, electrically charged success, capturing the essence of these two adored musicians with a synergistic magic that, unbelievably, does them both justice.",1
 Well meaning but paint-by-numbers biopic of boxer Roberto Duran simply takes too many swings and wanders all over the place in search of a POV.,0

 There are movies you want to like that just won't let you.,0
" The by-play between the stars is riveting, with Deneuve boldly playing against type as a gluttonous, gambling harridan. Moreover, it's good to see a film exploring midlife ennui from a female perspective for a change.",1
 Unquestioned patriarchal tradition and desperate responses to its oppressive power are dramatized in the Iranian director Jafar Panahi's sly and defiant metafictional road movie.,1
 It's an excuse for a 90-minute orgy of car chases and crashes that thoroughly tests the audience's endurance and patience.,0
 A mostly jumbled array of biographical swatches.,0

" If, in real time, the dull X-Men Origins prequel actually were the first X-Men film produced, it might have been the last.",0
" Steven Spielberg ditches the anchor which is George Lucas and teams up with Peter Jackson and his WETA funhouse for The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, a magnificently made action adventure filled with spirit but lacking soul.",0
" Fogelman tries to tug on the heartstrings by giving us a story full of people who go through some harrowing, emotional ordeals, but it constantly rings hollow. ",0
" Before the Devil Knows You're Dead brims with possibility, but very little of it actually works.",0
" The movie's driving force is Watts, whose depiction of a professional spook attempting to negotiate a political minefield as well as hold her stressed-out marriage together is thoroughly convincing.",1
" In the obligatory boxing terms, Balboa will K.O. your expectations, but that may only be because they're rightfully below the belt to begin with--and because this sixth installment is coming after the bell has already rung.",1
" Robert Aldrich's ""daring"" 1968 mating of lesbianism and commerce was, as I recall, considered pretty tame even then; lord knows what it looks like today.",0
" There are more phones than female characters, who spend the movie comatose in hospital beds, fretting silently in the background or being hugged through a doorway ",0
" Relieved of the action-stalling expository responsibility that dogs so many movies based on superhero comics, Blade 2 goes straight for the jugular.",1
" As insight into just what goes on during Robbins' events, the film is both moving and remarkable.",1
" As usual, the humor ranges from the blissfully sophomoric (such as Homer's rendition of a ""Spider-Pig"" theme song) to the bitingly satirical (such as the appearance of President Schwarzenegger).",1
" A good movie, but definitely not for everyone, as much like the marines starring in this show, most of your time watching the film is spent waiting for ""something"" to happen.",1
" Jab Tak Hai Jaan (JTHJ) is Yash Chopra's last film as director and it's a film rich in philosophy, poetic love and honest emotions.",1
" The longest, darkest, most surreal and sadly weakest entry in the series. The second film, for all its problems, had more fun and energy",0
 A disastrous cinematic vehicle that goes so wrong in so many ways it ranks alongside 2009's Sandra Bullock-starring All About Steve in the annals of recent A-list blunders within the genre.,0
" The dialogue is never dull or one-sided; these are intelligent, articulate people, given to debate and philosophizing.",1
" The movie's only wrinkle is that it is, in a crude fashion, post-modernist. Pardon me while I alert the media.",0
" In a disconcerting shift from campy horror to ultra-naturalistic violence, cinematic conventions gives way to depravity and cruelty of such intensity as to be beyond genre.",0
" Pollack drives this movie as if it's a well-tuned automobile, taking turns smoothly, accelerating at the right moments then easing off the gas pedal without ever losing momentum.",1
" It's hard to see where to land... and Beatriz at Dinner doesn't stick the landing. But Hayek, all serenity slowly leaving her face, will stick with you.",1
" Nothing is overplayed, from the scary surveillance tracking methods to the high-level corruption, making this a superbly crafted masterclass in intelligent action film-making.",1
" Brooks and screenwriter Alison Tilson pursue a notion of Asian-influenced understatement in their own sunny, big-boned Australian way.",1
 [Dumont's] sixth film and perhaps his most compelling ...,1
 The picture is about gender politics and a legacy of communal repression that is itself too embarrassed to port over a nearly-platonic-anyway love story between two women.,0
" Manages to break free from heavy iron genre chains and provide a spooky event that might not send the average viewer screaming out of the theater, but it could induce some heavy fingernail chewing during the ride.",1
" What is it about the biopic genre that gravitates toward the same sea of cliches, no matter what the sound or era?",0
" Nobody likes a fixed fight, except the backroom boys making the deal. Which is why The Break-Up may have its share of laughs, but isn't much fun.",0
 Battle of the Sexes is just a flat biopic that more often than not feels like a bad parody.,0
" Logan's movie is a flop on many levels, a musical in which America's most macho actors, Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, are miscast and required to sing.",0
" Despite the depiction of rivalry and discomfort, its tone is not harsh; there's something restrained and carefully poignant about the film and the rueful reverence it displays for its central figure.",1
" Even if the humor in the film is merely pleasant and conventional for the most part, the characters themselves are massively enjoyable.",1
 Kevin Kline and solid production values raise it from the doldrums.,0

 A modern horror movie featuring a non-ironic shower scene is far less knowing than it pretends to be.,0
 Oscar's material in sight. Forgettable. One hit wonder. [Full review in Spanish],0
" No matter how dark your sense of humor, the Bush Administration's joke has become a harsh reality. There's no spark of humor when you're staring into an abyss.",0
" The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film. Not everyone will play the dark, challenging tune taught by The Piano Teacher.",1

 Rosamund Pike has given the performance of a lifetime in the film.,1

" Enjoyable, but less fun than such low-stakes predecessors as 'The Phantom Empire' with Gene Autry and 'Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter.'",0
 I always hate the shaky camera style but I think Marc Forster is better at it than Paul Greengrass. It's his editing... I guess I just speak Forster.,1
" If you were there with them, in the clubs, you might have a good time with this movie. But for everyone else, this is a party you can skip.",0

" The film delights in some aspects, disappoints in others, does a deft job of depicting the sloppy, senseless mess that adulthood and adult relationships inherently are.",1
" ""The Princess of France"" has an appealing lightness and modesty, but it also feels flimsy and thin, like clever scribblings in the margins of a book, fleeting insights in search of form and energy.",0
" Subtle, quiet, delicate and unpretentious, Gloria is among the most satisfying films I have seen in years.",1
" What's so fun about this silly, outrageous, ingenious thriller is the director's talent. Watching a Brian DePalma movie is like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers.",1
" It's a lovely yarn, simple and sly, but what it's spawned is often painful.",0

 A mediocre effort that nonetheless succeeds in its main goal of keeping its blue characters alive for future merchandising purposes.,0

" It's obnoxious, derivative, and ultimately an empty experience.",0
" Like a Victorian settee infested with vipers, Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden mixes the elegant and the dangerous, the refined and the venomous; it affects refinement and crawls on its belly. It's also apt to bite.",1

" Good, bad, and weird in equal amounts, it's the best apocalyptic sci-fi-romcom-melodrama-dance-off date movie of the year.",1

 Very few movies capture as convincingly as A Separation does the ways in which seemingly honorable decisions can lead to interpersonal conflict -- even disaster.,1
" After all the dramatizing to protect the innocent is done, the story has a nice, comfy Hollywood ending (complete with baked goods), but it's fun to ride the myth for a while, especially with such comely partners.",1
 The ending feels like M. Night Shyamalan gone all wrong adapting Stephen King. Still Will Smith gives a solid performance and Sam is sure to become legend among Hollywood canines.,0
 The only way to stop the cinematic juggernaut known as the teen romantic comedy is for the target audience to come to its senses and stop supporting the darn things.,0

 The sketch comedy series was truly ahead of its time.,1
" Because of the allegorical nature of its people, ""Adoration"" never fully brings them to life - especially, and most crucially, Simon and Sabine. They are mouthpieces before they are human beings.",0

" If you think the summer has been lacking in sophisticated adult entertainment, don't worry, 'The Help' is on the way. ",1
" Has nowhere near the conceptual sophistication of Rear Window, where the protagonist's absorption in what he's watching mirrors the viewer's. The problem with Disturbia is that for most of the film you'll wish you weren't watching at all.",0

 The film fictionalizes his life story so aggressively that it's no less (or more) entertaining than the average rom-com.,0
 The Dark Tower unfortunately won't be a film that will be remembered beyond the final credits and boasts a cast whose talents are far superior to the story being told.,0
" Rather than romanticizing their drug-fueled youth, T2 is about accepting that reality and finding value in it.",1
 Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldn't be more timely. But it's also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither.,0

" I Am Not Your Negro is an utterly brilliant film - bold, galvanising, even gripping... ",1
 It's hard to know ... whether I've simply had it up to here with Anderson's archly cute portrayals of the troubles and eccentricities of the fabulously well-to-do.,0
" Deficient in the comedy of reticence discouragement that is Aardman's (or maybe just Nick Park's) unique strength. I don't want to say the Englishmen were corrupted, but I think they allowed their strongest, quirkiest instincts to be tethered.",0
" The Mechanic is my kind of action movie: nasty, brutish, brisk and ass-kicking.",1
" Thanks to a feeble script, bland direction and - God, why? - those impenetrable accents, no one emerges from this fiasco with much dignity.",0
 Acker's originality pretty much ends at his visuals.,0
" In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed.",0

" It's the sort of bizarre, ill-conceived picture you can't believe exists, but are secretly glad it does.",0
 What is most frustrating about this franchise is that the films are just competent enough to escape the fun-filled glades of Schlock Valley. ,0
" Simon Pegg is likably smart and obnoxious as the fish-out-of-water Brit in high-gloss Manhattan, but he's swimming upstream in a feature that substitutes slapstick for scathing wit.",0
" Asako I & II is a coolly-executed but emotionally numb exercise, and its somewhat traditionally demure heroine seems unlilkely to play to contemporary international tastes in dramatic heroines.",0
" Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment.",0
" I was with him 99%, but the stupid last-minute USA bashing [ticked] me off.",0
 This isn't a particularly memorable film. It borrows too much from other movies to stand out in it's own right. But it's a surprising one. What makes this odd 80s mash-up so intriguing is the way it's almost impossible to second guess.,1
" in the wake of the Tarantino-Rodriguez Grindhouse double-feature (2007), postmodern 'guilty pleasure' revivals are a dime a dozen, which is why much of the sheen has come off Espinoza's latest knowingly daft genre-blender.",0

 Blair Witch follows the original's beats so precisely that at times it seems the film is more eager to elicit memories of its predecessor than to stand on its own at all.,0

 The animation is lush and the screwball dynamic between Tiana and Naveen lively.,1
" Smart, silly, splenetic and a bit smug, it's a movie that might put a viewer's teeth on edge were it not for its winning lead performances.",1
" There's an important story to be told here, but this dramatic adaptation of the book by David Finkel may not have been the best way to tell it.",0
" Lizzie tries to find the seemingly impossible balance between family drama, murder mystery, and queer romance. Though it's a compelling idea, it doesn't work-the forbidden love story isn't fleshed out enough for that motive to be believable. ",0
" It would've been nice to tell you Insurgent was surprisingly good. Or fun to rant and rave about how lousy it is. But no. It's just there, another middle installment of another teen-targeted post-apocalyptic series.",0
" Sunset is a film awash with such delicious ambiguities, almost to the point of damaging its basic cogency at times... Yet the ambiguous will always face such early criticisms and I not only plan on seeing Sunset again; I will relish the challenge. ",1
 Wind's not necessarily for the armchair historian; it's more gut-wrenching than intellectual.,1

" George is mild, toothless and amusing only for the smallest children.",0
" And while some of the script felt as though it had been lifted from Julie's book, rather than anything anyone would actually say, you still couldn't argue with the power of it.",1
" The film can be appreciated, if only as a showcase for its assured, emotional attuned performances, as a convincing time capsule and period piece, and as a chance to reconsider one of the more well-known and still-influential studies of its era.",1

" Aside from a handful of half-decent turns, this would not pass a History GCSE, let alone the scrutiny of those it is intended to please. What a waste.",0
" Sheerly as film, Primary Colors generally sizzles.",1
" MacDonald's perky performance is a distinct plus, especially because Keaton's character is so enigmatic he's unfathomable, while the movie's lack of pace is only partly offset by some very subtle camerawork.",0

" Beneath the surface outrageousness lies a surprisingly, satisfyingly dark little fable about the essentially cannibalistic nature of artistic inspiration.",1
" Ultimately, as crafted as Killing Them Softly is, it's less satisfying than either The Sopranos or Goodfellas. Still, Dominik and his cast cruise some very mean streets indeed.",1
" Shocking, essential documentary looks at the shameful and avoidable failure of the NSA to prevent 9/11. All Americans (and everyone else) should see this film.",1

" ""Dark Shadows"" is amusing, in fits and spurts, and sure to make tons of money, but terribly familiar and fatigued.",0

 At first it's shocking. For a while it's grimly amusing. After that it gets simply repetitive.,0
" There's really no clear reason why a remake was warranted or why Statham, so exquisitely calibrated to action-comedy weirdness, would sign on to rehash the (far better) past glories of humorless Seventies action flicks.",0
 Salt is about as believable as a secret training program for military pilots consisting entirely of kangaroos in flight helmets. But it must be said that the star carries her load admirably.,0

" It was shot in Cuba at Hemingway's actual house and haunts, but that's all there is to recommend about this tired film.",0
 Alice Through the Looking Glass is a needless sequel that at least gets some points for imaginative effort.,0

" Not only do the pieces in the movie's puzzle seem mismatched, but the whole enterprise is marked by silliness and over-reach.",0
" A deeply moving portrait of a human being, suffering in life and not having any handle on how to deal with it. It's tragedy, not melodrama.",1

 On Her Shoulders is close to being awful.,0
 A watered-down tone ... causes the movie to drift dramatically between its musical and dance sequences.,0

 The scares are non-existent (being pulled backwards along the floor into a darkened room hasn't been scary since Insidious in 2010).,0
" This film is not especially complex, and not subtle, but there is judgment and intelligence in the simple idea of survival being the most agonising thing, and making survivor guilt the psychological aftershock of a shattering and irreparable blow.",1

" Unhappy Campers is like a good prank, one that is unfortunately ruined by an obvious wink.",0
 The Hunger Games is a mess.,0

" The Hunter is a taut, thought-provoking and ultimately touching drama with wonderful work from Dafoe, O'Connor and Sam Neill as a local guide with conflicted loyalties.",1
" They soon resort to head-banging antics as well. There are some eye-popping images, to be sure, but too bad Dumont didn't go to Bingen for the music.",0
 Genocidal Organ's alternate reality cuts the closest to our own: a world in which the shadow of the past and its assorted traumas holds the future hostage.,1

" What looks like a rather standard buddy action comedy is elevated by a smarter-than-normal script, skilful direction and surprisingly offhanded chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg. ",1
" The story has periods of great invention, too, offering both an ingenious combination of time and space as well as the sublime use of different speeds of sound. ",1
" One of the most beautiful things ever put on the big screen. On the other hand, the story is far too thin for adults, and far too dark for kids.",1

 Sequelitis is apparently not purely an American phenomenon.,0

 Romanian prison drama is cold porridge.,0
" There's nothing wrong with #3, but there's nothing especially delightful for surprising about it, either. And it's definitely not original.",0

 Fellowship is exciting for two hours. How many other movies can you say that about?,1

" Profane, hyper-violent, and never hesitant to take things a step or two beyond overkill, Deadpool is just the swift kick to the junk the genre needs.",1
" The subject matter strains under the weight of a full-length film, even one that runs only 84 minutes. Much of the running time feels padded out.",0

" Essentially Crime & Punishment for the eco-hipster set, Night Moves is a compelling drama that treats the characters' beliefs, and the eventual consequences of their actions, to a compelling cross-examination.",1
" Happy Death Day 2U finally collapses under the weight of its own ambitions, as well as some unfortunate forays into slapstick.",0
" Director Paul Morrison nicely re-creates the period, but puts too much weight on the sexual relationship as determining the men's artistic courses.",0
" A masterful double-bluff. What starts as a taut, topical drama about medicated America becomes a classic, twisted neo-noir that sees Soderbergh pushing aside on-the-nose themes in favour of sheer entertainment.",1
" We understand that Dwight's mission of revenge is juvenile and indefensible, but Blair manages to make us root for him nonetheless.",1
" ""The Signal"" is completely underwhelming --- not enough science in the fiction. And certainly not thrilling.",0
 Another case of elegant filmmaking kneecapped by a thunderingly stupid concept.,0
" It's precisely the type of film the critics hate. Ignore them, yahoo'd be a fool to miss it.",1
" A very attractive, accomplished and surprisingly pleasing dish of heartwarming romance, mystery and moving historical drama, directed by the dab hand of Mike Newell and played out by a cracking ensemble.",1
" The film strives for horror in the way of The Shining or Silence of the Lambs, but it's more like Annabelle with better cinematography, which isn't a compliment.",0
" The director's near-silent tour of quaint European street scenes is even more adept at making the picturesque seem pretentious, as well as at reminding you that male-model good looks don't make antisocial behavior any less creepy.",0
 Better to go in unaware and let Edgerton take you where he will.,1
" There's still something about I Kill Giants that feels projected, a work more informed by empathy than experience.",0

 It's truly wonderful; even followers of Zoroaster can dig it. The choreography is particularly spiffy.,1
 The story is where this movie falls apart from a grown-up's view. It's got an overwritten script that seems like it's been churned out of a weekend screenwriting course.,0
" If there is such a thing as a warm-bath movie, The Second Best Marigold Hotel defines it. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy just get better with age in a mild comedy that celebrates life to the very end. ",1
 The kind of wholly misconceived thriller that begs asking precisely what its filmmakers were seeking to accomplish.,0

" Truly disturbing hard edge heavy metal laced scenes, however simulated, of the mass slaughter by military helicopter gunships of a mix of healthy and infected fleeing humans by their own government, really confounds as to who the actual monsters may be.",1
 Biel's performance lacks the zing needed to jolt this comedy of manners.,0
" The movie might satisfy bloodthirsty action fans, but for most people, this is one Stallone do-over we could have done without.",0
 Remains true to the Chekhovian flavor of this classic by Tennessee Williams.,1

 Good action but nothing else - and the open ended ending is getting old.,0
" There's something about The Soloist's aura of religiosity that seems simplistic. An unsatisfying, jarring note, in this otherwise hopeful, triumphant story.",0
" It is quiet, restrained, unfussy, and has, at its heart, an injustice so grave it will make your blood boil. You will also cry. ",1
" A repetitious, rather formless jest that will wear out its welcome for many viewers long before jerking to a halt at the two-hour mark.",0
" Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street.",0
" Long after you've seen the film, you'll remember the wonderfully nuanced work of the cast, particularly Ms. Hawkins.",1

 A sword-and-sandals drama that hammers home the virtue of honor but then goes around the bend.,0
" Be all that as it may I just can't recommend this thing. It made me feel dirty and ugly, and by the time it was over I wanted to run home and take a shower to get the filth off of me.",0

" [W]hile the film offers silly fun for a while, its ultimate schizophrenia and self-seriousness become its undoing.",0
" In the end, it's a nice tribute not only to one of the comics' greatest characters (and this year's favorite movie hero) but the sort of truly unhindered, uncensored imagination that makes all fiction possible -- and all love real.",1
 [T]he film is a delightfully spry vacation into the life of a woman who doesn't really deserve the affectionate film around her.,1
" There's plenty of drama to draw upon, and the steady Redford is wise to let the action unfold smoothly, teased out in testimony and flashbacks. ",1
" While this ambitious Norwegian historical adventure sometimes dips into melodrama, it's a riveting, fascinating true story about passion and tenacity. ",1
" With his athleticism and unerring timing, Reynolds was obviously born to don Deadpool's apparently smelly catsuit.",1
" This film is one long biopsy of pure horror: the tumours of sentimentality and bad acting metastasise everywhere, and Bernal, in particular, is horrendously bad.",0
" Making movies steeped in vagueness these days is proving to be an excellent way to earn critical praise, but being artfully ambiguous strikes me as a way to cover for not being able to finish the job.",0
 A trip to the innermost circle of comedy hell.,0

 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines achieves neither the cult tang of the original nor the spectacular melding of FX to a gripping story that T2 did so well.,0

 Its story is so incompetently constructed that the long lulls between nonsensical action scenes make you wonder if it was written by a prepubescent fan.,0
 Don't be put off by the title. Wells harnesses 3D mo-cap wizardry for a children's adventure that balances storytelling and sci-fi.,1

 The latest in a long line of condescendingly inspirational sports movies about a catalog Caucasian who learns that people of other races are also capable of being decent.,0

 The Fountain is a giant step backwards into New Age nonsense.,0

 Wow special effects and a top supporting cast can't override the numbing length of this best-of disaster movie blockbuster.,0

" Some will balk at the idea of a faith based horror film, however The Remaining successfully manages to walk the fine line between bloody-minded entertainment and religious discourse.",1

" As Sydney White again demonstrates, [Amanda Bynes] just doesn't seem to have found a script that lives up to her comic potential.",0

 A raucous comedy about two wild and wayward sisters who just want to have fun.,1
 It's painful to watch.,0

 A Dog's Purpose will find a great Hallmark Channel following among folks who refer to their pets as their children and mean it.,0

 'Outlaws' is an Australian biker throwback that throws back to some of the worst aspects of American exploitation cinema.,0

 The Rite is devoted alright -- to exorcising all thought with an arsenal of would-be scare tactics.,0
" There are moments, especially towards the end, when Hank's behaviour comes across, to my eye at least, as a moving examination of mental illness, of isolation in the ordinary world.. I could have done with more of that, and less of a farting corpse.",0
 This movie is as much a eulogy for a country that Eastwood sees as slowly crumbling as it is for the life Earl chose to lead.,1
" [If] Sam Peckinpah, John Boorman, or Arthur Penn ever opted to direct a low-budget 1978 horror flick, it might look a little like Carnage Park. ",1
" Trying to balance the demands of his well-meaning motives with the requirements of the genre leaves Allen unsettled and ineffective, two words that encompass the creative drought evident in Cassandra's Dream.",0

 As frightening as a bedsheet flapping on a clothesline.,0

 The noir tension and jolting violence fall apart in the finale.,0
 Safe and sane and bland.,0
" Give us more, you feel yourself groaning: if anyone can take it, it is an audience that has paid to see a film about Alfred Hitchcock.",0
 [Midnight Special] occasionally feels like it's going off the rails -- and off its head. And yet Nichols' cast is so good and his handling so assured that it never quite flips out.,1
" Cannon bounces through every frame hopped up with excess energy, rolling his eyes, spitting off rotten one-liners and overselling his blunt reactions to eye-splitting excess.",0

 How long are we going to have to start enduring jokes about -- or from -- the 80's? [Full Review in Spanish] ,0
" The real drama lasted less than ten minutes. Yet still the film unfolds like a thriller, and a grippingly good one, for which Eastwood must share credit with his screenwriter, Todd Komarnicki, and with his star, Tom Hanks.",1
" Josh Holloway tries his hardest, God bless him, but Battle of the Year 3D can't even be enjoyed as a blissfully dumb entry in its genre. ",0

 A flawed but compelling introduction to Marvel's newest hero.,1
 More like the Bland and the Mediocre... It's impossible to believe this is a Sam Raimi film.,0
" The modest charms of Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason are a triumph of performance, production, and adaptation over the empty-calorie dither of its source material.",1
" While it has more and more explicit sex scenes than Fifty Shades Darker, they are presented with clinical disinterest.",0
" The result is a ""compare and contrast"" experiment, one that feels unevenly paced and soft in focus because ideas that might have worked on the pages of its source book have not translated well into film.",1
" In an era when superhero flicks hit theaters with the same frequency as bugs hit windshields, Captain America: Civil War still manages to rise above the fray and declare itself one of the finest pictures yet from Team Stan Lee.",1
" Built on dynamic set pieces and jet black humour, it's reminiscent of last year's Drive. It's a shame then, that Dominik saddles the film with a heavy-handed political subtext that would echo much louder if it spoke a little quieter.",0
" Here we have an ingenious concept told with no ingenuity, depriving viewers of even the baseline pleasures of the hack'n'slash genre.",0
" Unfortunately, no one involved seems to have bent over backwards to make the movie either original or even all that scary.",0
 It's a very pretty looking thing (maybe a little too pretty) featuring strong performances from both leads.,1
" Disturbingly manipulative and yet totally conventional, The Forest is more memorable for being opportunistic than for being truly frightening.",0

 The results are heavy-handed and oppressive in the way that vanity projects and bloated collective theatre experiments often are.,0
 'The BFG' possesses a magical sense of oddball wonderment all its own.,1
" The Adventures of Tintin showcases Spielberg at his entertaining best, a master of cinematic escapism suitable for the whole family.",1
" The film takes on a dour note as way too much time is spent on Saint Laurent's drunken antics. He comes across as sullen and not very likable. This may be true to the man, but what of his other side?",0
" The film really lives or dies on the integrity of its plot mechanics, with nary a theme to subvert or exploit. And to that end, it winds up as a calamitous heap of mangled gears, snapped levers, and rusty springs.",0
" Williams tries his best with the lines he's given, but they make up a sermon that we and every other character is simply bludgeoned with.",1
" Try remaking the classic drugs-and-cops thriller 'The French Connection' without the style, without the electric chase scenes or the witty cat-and-mouse game. Without the French. Without Gene Hackman. What you'd get might look like 'A Man Apart.'",0

 Didn't really suck and sold me on its lead relationship between Garner and the great Mark Ruffalo.,1
 Too daft for drama and too solemn for satire. Merely lost.,0
" Dare portrays teenagers with actual depth, breaking away from the conventional stories we see so often in films involving high schoolers these days. It'll stick with you long after the movie's over.",1
" Despite some big laughs, it becomes overloaded with quirks and contrivances, especially among its subplots and periphery characters.",0
 Isn't half bad because you sense the filmmakers approached a limited concept with the right amount of fun and dedication in mind.,0
 Nim's journey is profoundly moving...,1
 The mix of silly comedy and innocent love turns the viewer into a willing tourist.,1
" Cinema can restage the past, but can it absolve it?",1
 What should have been an entertaining romantic comedy from Crowe turns out to be an overly disappointing one. Shame on him for squandering such talent! ,0
 Another kooky and over-baked visually spectacular film filled with lavish costumes and spooky goth style from director Tim Burton.,0
" Many rounds are spent in this film, a few cars explode, and Gina Rodriguez becomes a version of The Punisher by the end, which feels like a set-up for an even more absurd sequel. Do yourself a favor and stream or rent the original.",0
" Oscar calibre acting, a time fragmented structure that works beautifully until the film pulls completely into the present in its third act and an authenticity of time and place...",1
" There's a serious mismatch between the personality of Samantha McIntyre's script ... and Larson's directing style, which feels entirely incompatible with whimsy.",0
" While Hedges' script gets a bit too convoluted in the second half, I appreciated the direct storytelling that simply allows Julia Roberts and Lucas Hedges to deliver.",1
" The Week Of isn't a good movie by any conventional standards, but it manages to clear the very low bar Sandler has set for himself.",0
" Has the sex appeal of a Road Runner cartoon, one-tenth the laughs and equal plausibility.",0
 It's a pretty lousy movie with some funny parts.,0
 Flashes of funny throughout indicate the comedic gem that could have been with better direction and writing.,0

 Teleporting Zombies! Hanging priests! Bleeding eyes! Organ regurgitation! The plot is meaningless and the characters senseless. But these are pluses for films in this cycle.,1
" Agripping, impressively detailed account of one harrowing voyage by a German U-boat during World War II.",1
" Any film that trashes the talent of Carrie Fisher is a loser in my book and this one stomps up and down on her talent. Don't worry Carrie, I still remember Leia.",0
" It's altogether as fascinating as a train wreck, and Gibney makes a convincing argument that Thompson was a true American original and an important literary figure shaped by the idealism, romanticism, politics and drug culture of the '60s.",1
 The Punisher opens itself up to ridicule in so many different ways I get giddy pondering all of them.,0
" Perhaps its fatigue with Cohen's comedic impulses or some good old-fashioned lazy writing, but The Dictator, while occasionally hilarious, is mostly flat and uninspired. ",0
" It nicely captures the seediness of L.A. in the '70s , but, despite a very encouraging first act, it loses steam and gets bogged down in its own narrative.",0
" Lilting can feel like an airtight glass box, but the figures inside it are vividly alive.",1
" A film about growth and recovery, about finding your way in life after the loss of a loved one and simply one of the best films I've seen this year so far.",1
" There isn't a tremendous amount of new information in this generally well-crafted documentary. But it makes a potent, urgent case against the merchants of doubt who play games with the planet's future.",1
" An anarchic, often hilarious adventure in dial-spinning, a collection of brief skits and wacko parodies that are sometimes quite clever, though they're just as often happily sophomoric, too.",1
" The 'cheeky' opening title card tells us Gary Spinelli's screenplay is 'based on a true lie,' and it is this flippant treatment that keeps the film from soaring higher.",1
" Terrific character actors such as J.K. Simmons furrow their brows. Streep responds by speaking in Red-State bumper-sticker slogans, ordering up some torture and then gnawing the heads off newborn babies.",0

 Would I see it again? I'd rather pass a kidney stone.,0
" While the characters are well drawn and the script gently amusing, it is also on the preachy side for adults - although young LGBTQ audiences certainly deserve the same sort of heroes and heroines that the straight kids have been indulged with for years",1
 A movie that offends every moral sensibility but delivers few comedic rewards.,0

 If only the movie was a better showcase.,0

" Doesn't make us want to see more final films split into two parts, but it makes the decision to do so in this instance feel absolutely warranted.",1
 A little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.,0

" Sit back, fall in love, and let it wash over you. Watch a star being born",1
 The Young@Heart Chorus has all the characters--and character--that any documentarian could ask for.,1
" In the case of Love, Gilda, it's all there. Gilda Radner never knew Lisa D'Apolito, but Radner left the filmmaker one heck of a gift. And watching Gilda Radner perform is still a gift, and now she left us all one more.",1
" It's not a horrible premise for a movie, but the execution is exceedingly trite and sloppy.",0

" A nerve-wracking thrill ride with surprises, wit and no small amount of heart, Son of a Gun's full of genre excitement and promise for Avery's future.",1
" Featuring compelling real-life figures who practically invite casting guesses for the inevitable Hollywood dramatization, Killing for Love should easily satisfy viewers who can't get enough of this stuff.",1
" Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility -- not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry -- the movie quite simply rocks.",1
" Anytime the ersatz Fela and crew are on screen performing numbers, the real Kuti isn't. And that's a shame, since watching the real Kuti onstage is as much concert as political rally and liturgy.",1
" For a movie about someone learning to come out of their shell, Jem and the Holograms is utterly confounding about what it even means to be authentic.",0
" Whether by accident or design, Is Anybody There? shares its youthful lead and '80s setting with funny, inventive Son Of Rambow. It hasn't emerged from its shadow.",1

 One of those movies that leaves you wishing you'd spent the time doing something more interesting.,0
" As strange as it sounds, DeVito's performance is about the only aspect of the film that isn't wholly fraudulent, if only because his typical feisty abrasiveness protects him from sinking to the level of Marshall's mawkishness.",0
" Although the script relies on gross-out body humor more often than it needs to, it manages to be deeper and more resonant than most girls gone wild comedies. A truly enjoyable trip.",1
" What distinguishes Castillo's film is the facility and accuracy with which she understands, remembers and recreates the fish-bowl vistas and claustrophobic intimacy of a long car-bound journey.",1
 Doesn't seem to know if it's coming or going.,0
" Director John Crowley has fashioned a film that feels like a natural evolution from the Victorian novel, one in which the circumstances are deceptively modern even if everything else feels somewhat old-fashioned.",1
 It's hard to fault Wiseman's optimistic contemplation of the almost familial atmosphere of democratic athleticism on the screen.,1
 This well-meaning debut feature about following your dreams just treads water.,0

" A treat for cineastes and sci-fi fans alike, with Melies borrowing from both Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.",1
" A pleasure to watch - part documentary, part personal essay, part unguided tour. It's a chance to understand ourselves differently by seeing the things we choose not to use.",1
" There isn't anything good to say about ""Kick-Ass 2,"" the even more witless, mirthless follow-up to ""Kick-Ass.""",0
" It's the year's best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events. In this one the events ring consistently-and dramatically-true.",1

" While Wrestling With Angels is definitely a worthwhile experience, you'd expect it to be a more dramatic one, considering what Kushner has produced.",1
" ""Doubt"" never quite works as a film for the simple reason that it is the kind of narrative that requires the intimacy and immediacy of the live theatrical experience for it to truly succeed.",0
 This isn't a radical departure from the previous films. Solid entertainment for fans.,1
 It's good a woman - an innovation/technology journalist-turned director - is the one to finally put everything (rumor and truth) together via a wealth of informative archival material and newly conducted interviews.,1

 A bunch of generic types get into a massive shootout in 211...,0

" Like its central character, this is beautiful and brave even if it fails to fully realise its potential.",1

 Appropriately super. ,1
 I've heard a lot of griping that critics are objecting to the idea of a too-soon reboot more than to the movie itself. Let me make it clear that this critic (and longtime Spidey fan) is objecting to the sluggish pacing and sloppy storytelling. ,0
" Ranks as perhaps the most violent PG-13 movie I've seen in years. I began to fear I'd be sprayed by blood, cartilage or other bodily fluids.",1
" Balances character, grit, spectacle and visceral action in a meaty, dramatically satisfying pie that delivers on the hype and will surprise many who felt the Hong Kong helmer progressively lost his mojo during his long years stateside.",1
" Basic, brazen, and scatologically obsessed, Plane forgoes any analysis of its essentialist japery, marveling instead at its own familiar naughtiness.",0
 The horror movie equivalent of a wimp who relies on steroids to lend him a fearsome appearance while his eyes still tell the truth.,0
" Shankman drops the ball at the finish line, jettisoning the tough-love fun for cheap sentimentality.",0
" The crises Ivan Locke faces with a tremendous will to do the right thing strike a chord. The mistakes that have him in the driver's seat, but hardly in control, are terribly human and all too familiar.",1
 There's a gut-wrenching sense of dread that saturates nearly every minute of director Robert Eggers' feature debut.,1
 Roll Bounce puts fresh spins on both the traditional family drama and a distinctive era of American pop culture. ,1
 It has about as many twists and turns as an L. The third act of a movie shouldn't make you feel as though the first two acts were a waste of time.,0

" Dredd is like a gun - not everyone likes them and they're only good for one thing, but they do that one thing really, really well.",1
" It's a mess, but ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" isn't an unpleasant one, maintaining signs of life with turns of plot and the sheer force of Denzel Washington's lead performance.",0
" The attempt to do something different and a bit darker is admirable but this Superman doesn't fly, it just assaults the senses. Where's the fun?",0
 By never deciding what it wants to be -- wacky comedy or action thriller -- this film fails miserably on both fronts.,0
" Jason Sudeikis in the lead? As a drug dealer who could never hope to pass for a picket-fence type? Please, the man looks like he was born in a Lands' End catalog.",0
" Vranik's film couldn't be more timely in its moral inquiry, but it's timeless in form and technique, a melodrama tempered with a painstaking realism.",1
" At times disturbing and always intense, this flick offers its own acid trip for viewers and is a first-hand look at four people who become trapped by their own hell.",1
" [Mitchell's] giddy, knowingly camp direction has a sort of glitter-stick DIY spirit that keeps the movie aloft long after the story itself has run out of road.",1
 its hackneyed dialogue and ridiculous bluster rank it a little lower than any of a handful of old gladiator movies made for a fraction of the price.,0

" Skimming the surface and romanticizing the reckless derring-do, it's infuriatingly ambiguous, just missing the mark.",0
" Kaurismaki's droll comic style remains his trademark. With the possible exception of fellow absurdist Roy Andersson, nobody's movies have quite the same rigorous diorama detachment.",1
" Cocteau's poetic aesthetic...the matter-of-fact extravagance...an otherworldly ambience...[combine to] strike an uncomplicated chord within us, directly connected to the wondrous nightmares of childhood.",1
 The first hour is a bore but a necessary gift to Watts. Each remaining frame is awesome though I could have done without Beauty's version of a simian lap dance.,1
" War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing but a good couple of hours at the theater.",1
" It's well made and entirely watchable, but it won't really appeal to anyone outside its target audience.",1
" You could pretty much call it Aladdin Goes to War and get the point. Videogame movies are usually pretty thin on plot, but Prince of Persia is one game noted for its story.",0
" Out-perversing Gus Van Sant's Milk, Soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence.",0
 Bad Santa is in fact the most belligerently crass and profane comedy to slither out of the studio system in at least a year--although it's also much less interesting than that sounds.,0

" While Chambers does add some resonance to the film as a sexual icon, her acting ability is decidedly limited.",0
" ""Claire's Camera"" is a film that fans of the director will definitely enjoy. However, at times it got me thinking what was its point, considering that this is the third production of a director who shoots similar films, in one year",0
" It's a balanced and honest look at young sexuality, and thankfully never didactic in its approach.",1
 This movie has more misfires than hits.,0
" 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is a cluttered, gloomy spectacle that does not live up to the three year wait. The choices made and direction by Zack Snyder have resulted in a shaky foundation for the Justice League.",0
" Writer-director Tyler Perry throws all kinds of ideas at us, but he never manages to get over the basic problem at the center of his script: Sumpter's character is shallow and unlikeable, while Haddish's... wears out her welcome in record time.",0
" On the film rumbles, raising a few more smiles than moments when you want to wince in discomfort or eat cyanide, but only a few.",0
" You can't hate 21 & Over, and you can't laugh at it. The most you can do is just pity it for not being as outrageous as it thinks it is. And as any guy will tell you, being pitied is the ultimate humiliation.",0
 ... there is a refreshing candor to this film that's wonderful.,1
" Not perfect and a little long but fun, chaotic, an full of action, humor, adventure and a carisma-filled cast that enjoys itself as much as it wants the audience to enjoy it [Full review in Spanish]",1
" Curiously staid and undramatic... wordy and somber rather than propulsive, thereby minimizing the urgency of Paul's life in contrast to what it portrays as his ultimate message of hope and forgiveness.",0
" Jude Law is great, sure, but Dom Hemingway remains a character in search of a story, uttering sentences in search of a script.",0
" Michael Bay fills ""Pain & Gain"" with flash and energy, and he does it well enough that the movie succeeds. But at the same time, it's a missed opportunity.",1
 Sometimes silly comedies actually have something to say. Fist Fight is not one of them.,0
" It's strange to say that a film about professional wrestling feels tenderly authentic and sincere, but that's how good the actors and filmmakers are.",1
 This movie plays like an after-school special or a public service announcement.,0
" It makes sense that the sequel to 2003's hit Bruce Almighty should star Steve Carell instead of Jim Carrey. Hilarious as Carrey was, everyone knows Carell stole the show...",1
" When the groans outnumber the laughs, you know you're watching a bad comedy.",0
" I'll take 'Ludicrous Stallone Action Flicks From the Late 80s' for $500, Alex.",0
" It's a kind of a mess. But it's a great mess, a staggering attempt to update something that Frank Capra might have made and place it in the bi-polar present.",1
" There is spectacular scenery and architecture to admire and footage of some of the world's best restaurants (tip: don't watch this movie hungry), but the main drawcard is as always the celebrity impressions.",1
" Zookeeper is a surprisingly good time at the movies, or maybe it's just too hot outside for anything in air-conditioning to disappoint... It isn't just the heat; it's the film's amiable stupidity. ",1
" Anomalisa is a transfixing, thoughtful, and touching film that goes deep into the viewer's psyche and stirs up emotions of introspective thought.",1
" The scenes focused on lukewarm dialogue outnumber the action scenes ten to one, giving the film a listless, low-energy vibe.",0
" The creators seem to have abandoned all hope of manufacturing anything that's even coherent, let alone imaginative.",0
" While easy on the eye and enjoyable for the most part, especially when Gosling occupies the screen, Gangster Squad has a few too many flaws.",0
" The final result is an adaptation that's just about as successful as its literary predecessor, with the film occasionally exceeding the book in a few areas...",1
" A mediocre, poorly paced thriller ...",0
" Offers giant rocks clearly made of Styrofoam and Dwayne Johnson, who fits the same description.",0
" Rarely has a movie felt more sketched out on the back of a napkin. It is riddled with distracting continuity errors and puzzles, including the undying question: what is a botanist even doing on Mars?",0
" No musical mockumentary can avoid comparisons to This Is Spinal Tap, so you may as well go for a near carbon copy. The gamble pays off.",1
" Infused with an almost relentless blandness, it's defined by soft comedy (a few laughs here and there), flaccid drama, and likeable actors.",0
 Branagh's performance falls flat when compared with those of Peter Ustinov and David Suchet. Since he is in almost every scene it made the movie even less enjoyable than it could have been especially since most already know the oft-told story. ,0
" Turned into fiction from the non-fiction bestseller by Eric Schlosser, Fast Food Nation sets up a scenario but fails to satisfactorily complete it",0
 Drug use and cliches mar unoriginal indie dramedy.,0

" Beauty and the Beast enchants again as a swirling blend of live-action story, stage, screen and sheer, rococo-spun fantasy.",1
" Metaphysical and emotional anemia is an important tradition in cult horror/mystery, a category the daffy plot twists and crimson, incestuous excesses of Angel Heart sit quite cozily in.",0
" Direction is superb, balancing action, story, character and something valuable to say in a compelling movie that you wish wouldn't end. And when the end does come, we wish all thrillers could be so genuine and real",1
 Whether or not the sadsack guy will get the girl doesn't stand a chance against a scene where Seth Rogen vomits in a packed church while wearing a Star of David sweater.,1

" The eerie buildup is mostly pro forma... But the backstory of the haunted house, revealed slowly in sepia-toned hallucinations, really is creepy.",0
" The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp -- as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action.",0
" What an astonishing, well-made historical drama.",1
" However turgid the storytelling, ""Emperor"" makes its historic points about a widely unknown 1945 wartime episode that played out in U.S occupied Japan after its surrender. ",0
" It was great to be back in the atmosphere of intense audience involvement after seeing so many films viewed in the dutiful stupor produced by ""quality"" cinema. ",1

" In Continental Drift, you find yourselves twiddling your thumbs waiting for the squirrel to show up and generate some chuckles.",0
" The first act is glacial, the extended universe connections weak and the entire concept and execution of L3 abysmal. But Ron Howard's cliffhanger confidence in the action and the smoky, alluring cinematography from Bradford Young carry it through.",1
" As Sausage Party breaks out of its Pixar-inspired packaging, so to speak, its repetitiveness evolves into a delirious cacophony of obscenities.",1
" Inspired filmmaking steeped in the imagery of silent film history, a dark Iberian strain of Roman Catholicism and the magic of fairy tales. ",1
" After a very ordinary start, 'The Help' genuinely surprises with amazing performances from Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain.",1
" The intriguing subject matter is, to an increasingly dismaying degree, rendered moot by filmmaker Morten Tyldum's run-of-the-mill sensibilities...",0
" Everlasting is clearly a work of love, and Anthony Stabley's film kept me wrapped up in its narrative until the final moment.",1

" ...a much better film than might be expected, even if it turns out to be as superficial as this season's scarf or handbag.",1
" With personalities never going deeper than what's expected in a mild comic sketch, and believability held in that limbo space reserved for exaggerated comedies, the film has little chance outside German-speaking territories.",0

" It's insubstantial, clumsy, and ineffective as either comedy or drama.",0
 ... plays with comedy and drama... [Full review in Spanish],1
" A Quiet Place, with its extremely well thought-out use of silence and noise, is another one of the new age pioneers that is stretching boundaries. Rarely has a scary movie been so filled with vulnerable protagonists and fraught with abject fear.",1
" [Scrooge] alternately haunts and taunts the author, but when the walls of the grave cave in on him, Plummer finds just the right note of desperation to melt our own hearts.",1
" It's possible to find some appeal here, but the overstuffed Sinister 2 has simply too much cheapness on its plate.",0
" Eastwood and DiCaprio have delivered a nuanced story about a man, a mythos, and an institution that relies on the facts rather than the legend.",1
 A creative and engrossing film about two writers trying to determine what is important to each other.,1
" We're treated to the illusion of intimacy and some witty rapport (mostly by Maggie Smith), but one leaves the theatre thinking the movie only scratched the surface.",0

" While there is a certain abject fascination in the unvarnished reality on display... the lack of an off-screen voice saying ""Yeah, but ..."" is ultimately maddening.",0
 What separates this one from all his rest? Not much.,0
 It's wider in scope than the first effort but just as funny.,1
 Glance in Need for Speed's rear-view mirror and you'll catch glimpses of... Vanishing Point and Two-Lane Blacktop. Bullitt even pops up on a drive-in screen at one point. Just don't expect any of those films' existential cool or stripped-down rawness. ,1
" Endlessly quotable, populated by endearing and unique characters, and blessed with a great score that mixes Elmer Bernstein's orchestral maneuvers with catchy oldies, this riotous comedy has lost none of its appeal over the years.",1
" The animation is charming, the musical numbers rather sweet, but the plot struggles for excitement, unexpected twists or comic moments.",0
 Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real.,0
" For a movie with the potential for so much global-warming electricity, it's disappointingly low on voltage.",0
" This is a nicely ragged and offbeat mismatched-buddy movie that, though it becomes a little predictable by the end, makes an unexpected hero of a profoundly irritating character.",1
" [It] is harmless, I suppose, except for its assurance that all a miserably suicidal person needs is a family of friends. Well, the many grieving friends of the many depressives who have attempted suicide ... might beg to differ with that diagnosis.",0
 Watching Toy Story 2 is like opening a box from the attic and finding your favorite childhood toys inside.,1
" All the low angles looking up at our heroes makes them look heroic, and the wide shot of all seven walking down the street feels special.",1
" Missing the crucial connective chord that ties it all together, the filmmaker inadvertently does a huge disservice to the culture he clearly holds so dearly.",0
 [T]his is a movie to curl up with on a chilly winter's night; this is the movie equivalent of a mug of hot cocoa...,1
 It's as if [director] Schoelermann and screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor had more of a concept than a concrete idea.,0
" Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden? jokes about Spurlock capturing the bounty on Osama's head, or making the world safe for his child-to-be, but it's really about the narcissistic filmmaker and his enablers the Weinsteins making a few bucks.",0
" It's a world where terrible things happen, but oddly there's a beauty to the film's darkness.",1
" I see a bright future ahead for this sui generis work, which will be passed around sixth grade classrooms by odd-smelling kids for years to come.",0
" Elles is ultimately an exploration of some very sound topics around women and sexuality, that feels about 10 to 15 years old. At its worst it's a Lifetime movie with explicit nudity.",0
" The event itself remains a stunner, but Clint Eastwood's somewhat drab drama sheds no new light on the media-shy pilot.",0
" Butler winds up as the last good guy standing in a building full of terrorists. So, of course, he's able to kill them off one at a time because, well, Die Hard.",0
 A quietly melancholic study of a father-daughter relationship playing out under the shadow of her terminal disease.,0

" No real suspense, and no payoff except for a groan-inducing, look-out-here-comes-the-sequel ending.",0
 Harry Brown is less Gran Torino and more knackered Ford Transit but just as compelling as the Clint vehicle.,1
" A messy, hectic, fitfully amusing film-nerd farce.",0
" ""Ben is Back"" has elements that absolutely work, but Hedges doesn't trust himself in the long run. ",1
" This low-budget indie has a unique ambiance and surprising depth, both in the performances of its two leads and the writing/directing team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.",1
" If you were to edit out all the superfluous and unnecessary bits in this Romanian police thriller, you'd probably have about an hour's worth of material at most.",0
" Brutally honest, Beautifully hopeful",1
" If you were to judge Let Me Explain purely on its performance portion, filmed at Madison Square Garden during Hart's 2012 tour, the film would merit a full extra star. But at 75 minutes, it feels too skimpy to rave over.",1
" Bigelow's gripping yet subtle study in the psychology of war is set to the urgent rhythms of a ticking bomb, exploding the myth of the maverick hero.",1
 Criminal isn't a very good to begin with. It also wastes a solid cast.,0
 Dramatically it's a deck as stacked as the one that unscrupulous bankers and realtors dealt to the borrowers who lost everything.,0
 The bad guys in Breaking In make the Wet Bandits from Home Alone look like Ocean's 11. ,0
" Understated yet deeply felt, Holmes' portrait of people who only have known hard times never strikes a false note, even when Josh Boone and Jill Killington's adapted screenplay wanders too far afield.",1
 I believe devoted Star Wars fans will be thrilled with the intense Rogue One. I liked it okay.,1
 Nesher's skillful hand as director and the convincing performances of the lead actresses allow both halves of the film to peacefully coexist without becoming overly schmaltzy.,1
" It does for hit men what Up in the Air did for frequent-flying corporate terminators, minus the comic tang.",1
" If Cage made a deal with the devil to never make a good movie ever again, Ghost Rider completes his transition from A-list star to industry punchline.",0
" Alexandra Dean's documentary will fill you in on Lamarr's remarkable, if troubled, life. ",1
 Dogs may be for life but the memory of this film will last about 20 seconds.,0
" Depp is as good as I've seen him, and Pacino is simply astonishing.",1
" When clever meets silly in this political spoof, silly always wins, but the cartoonish exaggeration works with some swift, perfectly timed comedy. ",1
 The film's disingenuous air of bittersweet chic becomes deeply tiresome long before it's over.,0
 A derivative mishmash of cinematic and real-life situations.,0
 So mediocre it can't even be called a valiant effort,0
" The finest installment yet in the series, valuing ridiculousness, pace, and wisely bringing in Trey Parker to energize the picture as Gru's latest nemesis. ",1
 The hyperactive sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets sends its archaeologist hero on a globetrotting quest that might have been devised after a long night of Wikipedia surfing.,0
 Put the blame on a script that maims the movie's middling intentions by playing New York City's ethnic vibrancy as either obvious joke or more obvious menace.,0
" As an auteur, Affleck's style is definitely worth watching, but his acting is still a bore, and he's fallen into the trap of putting himself in the lead.",1
" ""Teen Titans Go! To the Movies"" is often a riot. If some of the sillier moments and action beats are clearly aimed at little kids, so many of the jokes are adult in nature, while never dirty.",1
" Despite Binoche's mighty efforts, 1,000 Times Good Night never recovers from its self-congratulatory ambitions and mechanical plotting. It's the movie that winds up shell-shocked.",0
" Forceful and arresting, Ayer's follow-up to Harsh Times and Street Kings sees him confidently playing to his strengths.",1
" Competent but somewhat slack, modest (and modestly budgeted) shocker that doesn't work quite hard enough to justify its plot mechanics. [Blu-Ray]",0
" Mike Judge's Extract has some huge belly laughs, a terrific ensemble cast and more than a few instances of inspired comic brilliance. So why doesn't the movie ever really take off?",1
" The Invasion connects on a gut level in two ways, political and existential.",1
 Maybe more Angelina Jolie would have helped.,0
" Stallone still struggles to recapture the heroic prowess of his youth, but Schwarzenegger's having the time of his life as Sly's comic foil.",1
 It's weighed down by unnecessary narration and a surprising lack of conflict. But star Emily Mortimer and director Isabel Coixet create a character study of a rarity onscreen: an earnestly cerebral woman.,1
" Inherent Vice is a little too zonked, meandering and overly long, an ultimately pointless story told by a stoned person.",0
 'The Lego Batman Movie' is a well-constructed laugh-fest.,1
 Vanderbilt's - based on a self-serving memoir by Mapes - wilfully twists the truth to defend the piece that led to Rather and Mapes' joint fall from grace and greatly damaged the reputation of American journalists with the public.,0
 Just trippy enough...,1
 Darfur Now does one thing other documentaries on the region in western Sudan haven't done so far: It offers hope that something substantive may be done about the Darfur genocide.,1
" If it's a light, fun, unapologetically sentimental, comic cinematic treat you seek, Florence Foster Jenkins offers a celebration of grand delusion on an operatic scale.",1
" That there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but that a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle simply provokes disgust.",0
" Hostel is depraved, sick and disgusting - which means teenagers should love it.",0
 Friend Request is a thoroughly unpleasant and somewhat laughable horror movie with a warning to young folks at its core: be careful whom you friend on Facebook.,0
" I'd like to say there was a plot, only there isn't: it is simply a baroque and beautiful reflection of a five-decade romance with Rome.",1
" Gags involving plaster-cast penises, obscene topiary and alcohol-laced breast milk won't be to all tastes, but at its slapstick best the film is hilarious.",1
" A comparatively simple story may keep Timbuktu from reaching all-time status in films of its type, but it is still a film worth seeing.",1
" [A] brittle, beautifully understated San Fernando Valley character study.",1
" Believe it or not, Grown Ups 2 is better than at least one other movie in existence, and that movie is Grown Ups. ",0
" It deals with the contentious issues of faith and fundamentalism, hope and tolerance through the boy's perspective...",1

 A film that feels like it wasn't finished being assembled before it was ushered out into the world.,0
" Lush. Debauched. Ravishing. And did I mention sexy? The Last Mistress, from French controversialist Catherine Breillat, is Dangerous Liaisons, uncorseted and undressed.",1
" A riveting, intense, visceral, smart and exciting summer movie that will rock your world.",1
" this action thriller never stops moving (except when Olga Kurylenko's kickass heroine Alex has her leg literally caught in a vice), racing through its series of genre routines in the hope that speed alone can cover over any cracks.",0
 Has a shambling charm...a cheerfully inconsequential diversion.,1
" Add romantic chemistry to the list of things that fall flat in the film, alongside dialogue and acting.",0
 Doesn't America's 50-and-fabulous set deserve better than a movie this superficial and pandering?,0
 [Geisel] was quite satisfied with the 1966 animated TV show and didn't think it could be improved upon. He was right.,0
 The marvelous film is an old-fashioned gangster flick set in a colorful traditional culture that gets caught up in the modern-day global world.,1
" Every time Transformers threatens to collapse under the weight of its ridiculous plot and boring characters, Bay and his team pull a visual trick that will blow many summer movie fan's minds.",1
" Focus, nicely filmed and very competent, delivers come snappy dialogue and fizzy, forgettable fun.",1
" For a filmmaker who's so attracted to psychological discomfort, Bier has a disarming affinity with the pleasure principle. In this she's further blessed to have cast the riveting Mikkelsen, who here displays the self-conscious jitter of the young Pacino.",1
 Bill Skarsgard [is] terrifying as Pennywise. Absolutely horrifying. ,1
 A smooth but frustrating third feature with an extremely good ensemble cast.,0
" Nocturama works so well because it does not spoon-feed us any answers. In fact, by the film's end, many may be left with more questions than answers. And perhaps that was Bonello's point all along.",1
" It's heavy on metaphor and voiceover, and weak on passion...",0
 RBG's superficiality makes it good background material about the subject and the forces that guided her life's crusade but the blinders it willingly wears represent its greatest flaw.,0
" It's a step down from its predecessor, but hey, aren't we all? It works well enough as yet another Rocky sequel.",1
" This egregious case of injustice...is an important story to tell, but although Ruskin attempts moments of poetry, he succeeds with the procedural more than the personal, his pedestrian direction dragging his movie down.",0
 It seems like it's all a cover for how simple and petty the central story ends up being.,0
 American Pie is no comedy classic; it's about as sophisticated as a whoopie cushion.,0
 ...plenty for the kids to watch that will keep them entertained for the duration of Shark Tale but not nearly enough to keep any but the less discerning adults amused.,0
" The film's universe is one of complex moral fabric, where red herrings fall like flies and paranoia, among other things, is in the water. ",1
 Irresistibly charming.,1
 The Zero Theorem falls short of its promise: events don't raise the pulse or excite the mind and even the marvellous Waltz seems a little adrift.,0
" It forces you to think about complicated issues while still being witty and engaging. You can't even say that about most teachers, let alone most movies.",1
" Killing Kennedy offers a fresh, if not biased take on the lives of two men that unexpectedly intersects and changes the nation forever. Will Rothhaar and Michelle Trachtenberg give the performance of their careers.",1
" The greatest rock concert movie ever made -- and maybe the best rock movie, period.",1

" It is one of the director's better movies of recent years, even if it is occasionally maddening.",1
" This is a fantasy realm so fully and elegantly realized, it might be the adaptation of a classic novel. Yet the source is Del Toro's own capacious imagination.",1
 Highly suspenseful yet full of conventional ideas,1
" Playing the incredibly spoiled (and remarkably talentless) Jessica Simpson meets Britney Spears meets Bimbo Barbie rock star Samantha James, Faris brings so much gleefully archaic fireball charisma to her portrayal I couldn't take my eyes off of her.",0
" The contrived setup doesn't make much sense, and the movie throws in far too many extraneous antagonists and dead-end plot detours, none of which are entertaining.",0
" Seriously sick, in the good way.",1
" While Ben Lear's documentary is reasonably clear about its own position on the issue, the film's material is so thin that it provides few reasons to believe the conclusion it's selling.",0
" It's all rather familiar, well enough acted yet not entirely convincing.",0
" There isn't much reason for this ""Walter Mitty"" to exist.",0
 [Whatever Works] has defenses built into it.,0
" The special effects, from the team behind Avatar, are mind-blowing, and easily distract from the muddied morals of a script that asks only vague questions about man playing God.",1
" A totally shameless, crudely manipulative tearjerker, but despite incredibly strenuous effort, it doesn't even succeed on that low level. ",0
" Touch Me Not is definitely abstract and intellectualized ... but so much of the film left me cold, even bored.",0
" Playing it straight would have been the subversive way to go here, but in the end, Tragedy Girls, like its protagonists, is too smug for its own good.",0
 What's frustrating is how consistently the film waffles between the inspired and the inept.,0
" Maggie Smith couldn't be more perfect for the title role in this film if it were written for her. But the most astounding thing about this story is that it's true, an event from playwright-screenwriter Alan Bennett's own life.",1
" Its themes of trust, the depth of filial responsibility and concerns about genetic inheritances are explored with depth and intelligence.",1
" As the old adage goes, you can't polish a turd. But you can sprinkle plenty of CGI and countless close-ups of Keanu Reeves looking morose onto it.",0
" The height of poor taste. Grants notorious men even more notoriety by giving voice to their inexcusable 'travails,' thereby feeding their self-absorption.",0
" The more ""Dayveon"" attempts to up the dramatic and moral stakes of its narrative, the less persuasive it is as idiosyncratic, indigenous storytelling.",0
" We have had few if any first-person accounts from ""crazy"" women filmmakers about how they see their own lives and minds. Animator and artist Signe Baumane's first feature, Rocks in My Pockets, seeks to change that situation. ",1

" The sex is tumescently explicit, the life dull and sad.",0
" Chamber of Secrets is not quite the magical mystery tour that the first one was. Despite some major improvements, the movie is often sluggish in pacing and intrigue.",1
" If some concessions to Indian cinema convention don't work, that's compensated by still-suspenseful and involving storyline and the committed performances by the actors.",1
" The beguiling creature design -- from minotaur to dragon, sea serpent to one-footed dwarf -- and 3D effects heighten the illusion of a storybook coming alive.",1
 Spirit gets by on the extreme care that went into giving its central hoofer a vibrant personality -- even if the other characters pale in comparison.,1

 After Tiller movingly dramatizes another side effect of the job: how difficult it can be for the doctors to not internalize the sadness of the women who walk through their doors.,1
" True to the Will Ferrell formula, going for the joke trumps plot and character development at every turn, with the trademark humor coming via nonsensical slapstick and such Seventies-era fashion statements as cotton-candy afros and loathsome leisure suit",1
 I'm still shaking my head over the implausible way this film ends.,0
 Worth taking for a spin in your Netflix queue.,1
" At 116 minutes, it's a test not of speed but endurance.",0
 A superb satirical swipe at the worst excesses of the social media generation. Deserves a lot of 'likes'.,1
" Although Gameau's film includes a fair amount of science, he and his helpers sweeten the film's statistics, delivering them in clever, accessible ways.",1
 I confess to finding it often opaque and slightly frustrating.,0
" James Schamus, the longtime maverick film producer who co-wrote many of Ang Lee's films, adapts the 2008 Philip Roth novel and directs this measured, serious, heavily introspective coming-of-age drama.",1

" A stunning cinematic achievement thanks to gifted director Andrew Haigh, who pulls indelible turns from Brit screen legends Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay.",1
 There are those who claim Transformers: Dark of the Moon is light years better than its misogynistic and puerile predecessors. Do not believe their rancid deceit. ,0

" Whatever purpose Vince's entourage might have served 10 years ago has long been buried for good in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. This isn't a commentary on Tinseltown, but a tepid bachelor party.",0
 The script favors routine Odd Couple gags over the sort of comic contemplation of motherhood a writer like Fey might have brought to the subject.,0
" At its worst, the film is agonizingly biopic-ish. At its best, it's a rise-and-fall movie where the first half is infinitely more compelling than the second.",1

" There's an effective love story at Testament of Youth's core, but the misery of this nuance-free adaptation of Vera Brittain's autobiography drowns the romance in tedium.",0
" A good movie that would be a better one if it were 15 minutes shorter, and a great movie if it were a half-hour shorter.",1
" It means well, and it does well by its cinematic means as a tearjerking melodrama through its style - even if the style overburdens the narrative flow at times. ",1
" There's absolutely nothing to cling on to, as a viewer that can engage you about this movie in terms of emotional content. ",0

 Everyone involved here is operating well below his or her skill level.,0

 A marvel. Director Peter Jackson's exuberance is evident in nearly every frame.,1
" Sacrifices credibility not only by the fact that it was co-directed and co-written by the obviously partisan Harry Thomason (along with Nickolas Perry), but also because of its cheesy cinematic style.",0
 The film is further undone by an overwrought ending and toneless conclusion that proves too soft to energize the movie's implied though underdeveloped social critique.,0
" What could have been a moving tale of a father and daughter reconnecting instead comes off as an interminably boring and pretentious bit of ""inside baseball"" ",0
" The behind-the-scenes tragedy gives Gilliam an easy excuse for the dull chaos that engulfs the story, but he might have generated it all on his own.",0

" It seems unfair to chide the entire film for one sagging act, so in the end, this first part gets a slight recommendation for its characters, art direction, and some thrills.",1
" A subtext of self-criticism runs through Vardalos's material. Over and over characters tell her, ""You're not funny. Stop trying."" Is it a sort of apology to the audience?",0

" The pathetic, witless state of modern film comedy and mass appeal. Even at this level, 'Land of the Lost' bores.",0
 It's the sort of film that sneaks serious themes and emotions in just when you think it's about to dissolve into farce. Small but largely satisfying.,1
 The visuals are as lingeringly rich as Carolina summers. The music is supervised by the legendary T-Bone Burnett and is authentic and poignant.,1
" It would appear that in addition to robbing his brood of their need for blood, Carlisle also removed their balls.",0
 A film so rife with plot holes that it would make a decent pasta strainer.,0
" This is a bitter pill, and it is difficult to swallow.",1
" The visuals are stunning -- which is unsurprising, given that it was directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. He clearly spends a lot of time perfecting the details -- of the film's sets, if not the story.",1
" Plot holes are glaring, even more noticeable thanks to the series of flat one-liners and any fleeting moments that do work are usually followed with long stretches that just lie on the screen like a fruitcake that gets re-gifted multiple times.",0
 Resnais is one of the few true directors to evoke such a cerebral cinema.,1
" [Saw is] spoiled by its own insatiable desire for envelope-pushing flair; it's wider-scoped when it should be intimate, splashy instead of subtle, icky but not scary.",0
" Fans at the screening I attended tittered throughout, perhaps finding the story's overwhelming cheesiness harder to take when seeing it enacted before their eyes.",0
 Frustratingly little light is shed on either Roth's life or his work by this series of interviews with the novelist and a curious selection of admirers.,0
 The wacky is forced and unfunny and the misery is nowhere near wretched enough.,0
" The directors lay down strong stamps of personality in their choice of subjects and mise-en-scenes, while employing touches of fantasy that range from teasingly surreal to unsubtly grotesque.",1
" Jon Hamm is well cast as a hostage negotiator in Lebanon but the film's maze of plots is confusing, thereby lacking real tension.",0
" An accomplished debut, with chilling performances from the two leads.",1
" Works best, not as a true-crime kidnap thriller, but as yet another reminder - always timely, and particularly now, as billionaires buy political capital - that all the money in the world can't make you happy, and will probably make you an ass.",1
" Oceans floods us with stunning visuals of the panoply of sea life. But without a compelling story, or a strong point of view, or mere information, we can only 'ooh' and 'aah' so much.",0
 District 9's skid into rote convention is matched by a retreat from the documentary conceit that so expertly delivered us into this strange world in the first place.,0
" Lots of style here, not nearly enough substance",0
 Stultifyingly vapid.,0
 It's terrible. It's awful. It's terawful.,0
" ""Lean on Pete"" is a film that takes its time, and asks you to do the same. It is one that requires thought and some patience. And that patience is rewarded with an ending sequence that feels like the peace that comes at the end of a very long day.",1
 The way the sincerity and silliness collide here is as awkward as Jon Hamm and Hannibal Buress pretending they went to school together.,0
" It badly botches what a Christmas special should be, and is worth watching mainly for unintentional laughs.",0
" Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming.",0
" It's shocking stuff, even if much of it has already been in the news. That's mostly because of the way that Scahill strings it together into a coherent, convincing argument.",1
 Where the film does succeed is in underlining its subject's credentials as an artist.,1
" Coppola shows genuine interest in emotional detail, and it accumulates into a depth of real feeling.",1
" Not great filmmaking, but will be appreciated by Francophiles.",1
" It's not a prequel as much as it is a lamprey, trying its best to nuzzle up to greatness.",0
" Everywhere you look, all the signs are there to tell you that this is a powerful movie with something to say. You investigate, and guess what? There's nothing there!",0
" It's marketed as a supernatural romantic comedy. The problem is that it's neither very romantic, nor comedic -- and things aren't appreciably better on the supernatural front.",0
" Rauch's Greggory is a brash, foul-mouthed creation who bends the will of the proceedings away from outright satire of celebrity to something surprisingly more engaging.",1
 Focus is great fun (if morally bankrupt).,1
" One sexy woman showing off her stomach does not a movie make, although, it doesn't hurt.",0
" Chalamet and Monroe sparkle, but the movie around them is a dull and contrived coming-of-age/learning-to-deal-weed melodrama",0
" It may be bloody, sleazy and populated entirely by trashy people, but this picture is also subtly stylish, sensationally acted and - if you appreciate extremely bitter humor - pretty funny as well. Somehow, someday, somewhere, 'Payback' will get its due.",1
" It isn't very funny and its assaults on the tear ducts are ham-handed and, for me at least, missed the mark at almost every turn. ",0
" Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides suffers from an extraordinary lack of imagination, something that cannot be said of its predecessors, convoluted and impenetrable though they may have certainly been.",0

 Fantastical Neil Jordan drama sees Colin Farrell's best performance yet,1
" We are treated to the requisite picturesque longshots and dewy close-ups, and yet the thing never connects. Instead of reaching for a tissue, I was checking my watch.",0
" The Selfish Giant earns all of its emotion the honest way. If it's at times painful to watch, in the end it gives back much more than it takes. It's generous and steadfast, like true friendship itself.",1
 The anguish of the lovers' decade-long separation can't be evoked in a matter of minutes ...,0
 'Trespass' is a pointless movie that does nothing to further the home invasion subgenre.,0
" Enthusiastic as one might be that Jack Lemmon has found a new lease on movie life with his Grumpy Old Men series, the funny-crankpots genre wears mighty thin on this road trip.",0
" What could have been an interesting premise and a nick at the seemingly utopian nature of suburban marriages disintegrates into a film that focuses on celebrating the hero, played by Kumar.",0
" Happily N'Ever After is proof-positive that Europeans may have us beaten in soccer, wine and luxury cars, but they still can't make a decent 3-D cartoon.",0
" It's a magnificent achievement -- holes, tatters, crudities, screw-ups, and all.",1
 Streep ... makes the character's delusional faith in her own talent so infectious that we ache at the thought of Florence's impending humiliation even as we prepare ourselves to laugh at it.,1
" Unlike more high-powered Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and X-Men, The Punisher has never enjoyed much box office success and this excruciatingly terrible film certainly won't change that.",0
" But, my, what sharp teeth Ms. Hardwicke doesn't have.",0
 You'll most probably find yourself raising your flippers in praise of Warner Bros. flightless fowl.,1
" [From] urgent, fast-moving cinematography, intense close-ups. . . and percussive soundtrack. . . to cautionary tale of the limits of being a young black female in France.",1
 The strong story line is enhanced by intelligent dialogue and first rate performances by a stellar cast.,1
" George Clooney is thoroughly likeable as the amusingly callous Ray - even watching him at the heart-breaking job of terminating folk en-masse is fun, but it is the women that give the film its heart.",1
" This is a surprisingly downbeat piece of filmmaking for a modern studio film, for which we should be very grateful. Whether that makes it in and of itself an entirely worthwhile endeavour is debatable.",1
" The pacing of this comedy is rather excruciating, things moving so slowly and with such ponderous precision maintaining interest in what is happening at any given moment is spectacularly difficult at times.",0
" Shyamalan might've been onto something if Lady in the Water were, say, a satire of Scientology; instead, it's a mission for a bedtime story, a badly told fairy tale.",0
" Overall this is a gripping, non-judgmental look at a young girl finding herself in the toughest circumstances.",1
" ... What it lacks in incisive satire, it makes up in big laughs.",1
 The film seems to think that the mere recognition of Gabriel as a narcissist sufficiently complicates the character's sense of entitlement.,0
 The fancy visuals serve only to distract from the emotional impact.,0
" Grappling with Churchill's inner humanity and steely resolve, Oldman has offered a portrayal for the ages.",1
" Blackhat, more than any Mann movie to date, represents a filmmaker alienated from his audience.",0
 Never develops into anything beyond a concept.,0
" ""Cloud Atlas"" wants to be more than it is. For a movie pitched as a Meta-Meta exploration linking the ancient past to the recent past to the faraway future, it nosedives before getting out of the gate. ",0
" The film's biggest asset, surprisingly enough, is Jason Statham, who shows terrific potential as an action hero, and could easily match wits with actors like Vin Diesel or Jean Claude Van Damme.",1
 The degree to which Mom & Dad ultimately disappoints is nothing short of staggering...,0
" A jaunty remake of the 1985 horror-comedy that gives Farrell his juiciest leading role in years, literally.",1
 Funny Face...teams Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn in a delightfully balmy romance.,1
" However arguably noble his film's intent to redress historical grievance, a poorly filmed shoot-out is never more than exactly that.",0
" Transitioning back into a scripted dynamic after his quasi-documentary performance excursions with ""Bruno"" and ""Borat,"" Baron Cohen loses none of his edge, combining slapstick inspiration and social commentary into a hilariously provocative blend.",1

" Splendidly silly in places, with its fondness for giant monster movies obvious, this popcorn extravaganza swerves haphazardly between knowing humour and a heartfelt warning about the plague of capitalism...",1

" Sandel's film has heart, some good laughs and a decent message. In this age of cyberbullying, that's nothing to scoff at.",1
" There are any number of ways that Cretton could have made this material precious or sentimental, but he honors the story by forcing us to come to the characters rather than by underlining everything with close-ups and obvious musical cues.",1
 This is probably the closest viewers will ever come to watching a family in this sort of crisis,1
" Though the dialogue explores some interesting territory, the couple remain elusive and a little dull; we never learn anything about them beyond the subject at hand, so they seem to exist in an odd, screenwriting-exercise vacuum.",0
 One of the year's very best films. A blast of absurdist outrage that's seriously funny until all of the sudden it's not anymore.,1

 It's a worthwhile examination of fame and an introduction of her work to a new generation.,1
 Lucas' gift for animating the inanimate turns out to be paralleled by a tendency to deaden what should be completely alive.,0

" Dumont is trying too hard to get these big laughs, and he's trying for too many.",0
" ...what, then, is the point of all the drama?",0

" 'Air Force One' without the presidency or the plane...the formula feels awfully tired, the plausibility quotient is ludicrously low, and Ford seems a bit long in the tooth.",0
" The latest version of Romeo and Juliet is watchable, well-acted and gains points for its locational veracity, but Fellowes' script takes some shocking liberties with Shakespeare's original that won't endear the film to literature students.",1
" Pointedly and joylessly explaining everything turns out to be this movie's favourite thing, I guess because aliens tend to struggle with our human emotions.",0
" Baumbach is as perceptive as there is when it comes to the way people talk and act, achieving an acute level of realism, even in a comedy as wonderfully absurd as this one. ",1
" Rarely is so much time, money, and cutting-edge technology expended on a spectacle so devoid of wonder.",0

 Time to get on the bus.,1
" This is a trifle of a film about a trifle of a film. But trifles can be appealing, especially English trifles, and this one is no exception.",1
 Illegal Tender has its moments -- including the aforementioned shootout involving Millie -- but it is ultimately undone by the litany of genre cliches it embraces.,0
" Goes all in on self-referential wackiness and an unbridled energy stream of sarcasm to unleash an apocalypse of silly, exciting fun.",1
" The camera races and races to keep this fast and furious young woman locked in its sights, turning her into an object of both pursuit and contemplation.",1
" Perhaps MacLachlan was after a visual vocabulary that was as limited as his film's dialogue. In doing so, he's sold his story short. This crop feels like it needed more time to come out of the ground.",0
" Shankman drops the ball at the finish line, jettisoning the tough-love fun for cheap sentimentality.",0
" Gripping drama about getting older; with drinking, sex.",1
" Tilting his elegantly aquiline features downward while hoisting one eyebrow over a dark orb, curling his lips with Grinchian deliberation, he seems to be determined to kill people on the strength of his cologne alone.",0
 The found footage element keeps geting in the way of a good teenage superhero film.,1
" The music is fun, but it's the pesky between-the-songs moments where Shankman's flimsily plotted, paper-thin mix tape of a movie loses its footing.",0
 An inoffensive one-joke valentine to freaks and geeks.,0
" He's a wealthy tycoon named Gray who takes a woman to her limits. I'm talking, of course, about '9 1/2 Weeks.'",0
" A less complicated, and less convincing, variation on The Visitor.",0
" A sketchy, flatly directed biopic based on one of the most compelling true crime stories out of New Jersey ...",0
" With a middle-school class clown's lowbrow cunning, Dr. Dolittle's creators have zeroed right in on the key element of successful audience ingratiation, the benign and endearing lead character.",0
 Did anyone suspect the underwear dancing guy in Risky Business in 1983 would end up an action hero? No. Some of us still don't think he's much of one. Jack Reacher is proof. ,0

" Victoria Chaya Miranda executes great direction, however, she is unable to capture the soul of the ""city that never sleeps."" [Full Review in Spanish]",0
 The ads say 'at last a movie for adults' and this time the advertising is not lying. A wonderful grown up movie. Gandolfini and Louis Dreyfus are terrific together.,1

" How bad could the boneyard be compared to sitting through this execrable piece of non-entertainment? Better dead than ""RED 2.""",0
 Will Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need.,1
 What could have been a perfectly fine premise for a high-key comedy is negated by the fact that both lead characters are incalculably unappealing.,0
 'The Artist' paints a glorious picture of old Hollyood.,1

" This sweet, play-it-safe adaptation of TV's honeybee heroine is as innocuous and uninspired as preschool animation gets.",0
" There's not a single human moment in the entire feature, which always hunts for a joke or sitcom conflict to get by, imagining the game of love as a tiresome CBS comedy pilot. ",0
" What Us makes abundantly clear is that Peele is an undeniable talent, so comfortable in his ability to build tension [and] so assured in his use of music, cinematography and editing.",1
" A kill-'em-all action flick that attempts to elevate itself with clumsy, rock 'n roll politics, dropping actual names and articles of political currency like catchphrases.",0

 Enough of the bits work and some are so funny that the overall effort comes off as contagiously enjoyable and often hilariously entertaining.,1

 It's a shame that an initially fast-paced romp like this limps across the finish line.,0
 The road to cinematic hell is paved with this sort of banal effort borne of bland good expectations.,0
 The sequel is like year two of a once-promising sitcom -- when the characters are methodically stripped of the edges that made them interesting in the first place.,0
